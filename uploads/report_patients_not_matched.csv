To further address this differential, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis demonstrated loss of a small segment of distal chromosome 7q and gain in the proximal portion of chromosome 11p. Chromosome 11p gain can be seen in association with Spitz nevi, especially, large and cellular Spitz nevi, and this molecular aberration is not common to melanoma. The segment of chromosomal loss in 7q is quite small and is not believed to be diagnostically significant.

This nodular proliferation developed secondarily within a preexistent Spitz nevus. I also understand that an adjacent congenital melanocytic nevus was noted clinically. To further assess the nature of this proliferation, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, completion of aCGH analysis demonstrated loss in chromosomal 1p with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. We have observed anomalies involving chromosome 1 in other examples of spitzoid melanoma. In summary, my interpretation of the the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH analysis is that a nodule of childhood-type spitzoid melanoma has developed secondarily within a preexistent Spitz nevus. The nodular population of melanocytes within this specimen is 1.6 mm in thickness. Please note that the negative prior analysis via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is unsurprising, as FISH testing only evaluates loci on chromosomes 6 and 11. To state it differently, the chromosomal anomaly that we have detected could not be identified via FISH.  The designation childhood-type spitzoid melanoma refers to an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Such tumors typically lack BRAF mutations and were reported in the past literature under such flawed designations as malignant Spitz nevus.

In some areas, the background epidermis is acanthotic, and in other areas the background epithelium is thinned. In areas where the epithelium is expanded, there are single melanocytes and nests distributed within the epidermis at all levels, and large and well-formed pink globules (Kamino bodies) can be found above dermal papillae. Below this, there are nests and cords of melanocytes that in some areas mature with descent. In areas where the epithelium is thin, a nodular array of non-maturing melanocytes is appreciable. These cells are slightly spindled and epithelioid in morphology and have amphophilic or finely melanized cytoplasm. Within these nodules, melanocytes in mitosis are relatively easily found. A juxtaposed sparse infiltrate of lymphocytes is apparent as well.",F,2.0,,,,,

I agree with you that while a Spitz's nevus seemed possible in initial sections, there are some unconventional features, and rare mitoses are evident in the dermal component, raising the possibility of Spitzoid melanoma. The enclosed Ki-67 immunoperoxidase stains indicates a low proliferation index, however. As you suggested, we performed comparative genomic hybridization to determine whether this tumor contains clonal DNA copy number changes that may be of value in the differential diagnosis. This reveals multiple aberrations, including losses or gains affecting nearly all of chromosomes 7, 8, and 9, and gains on chromosome 5. These results strongly support a diagnosis of melanoma. Of note is that none of these aberrations would have been detected via fluorescence in situ hybridization, and these aberrations are not those associated with spitzoid melanoma of childhood. I have shared this case with my colleagues, Drs. Philip LeBoit and Timothy McCalmont, who agree with this diagnosis. Histopathologic features of possible prognostic importance include the following. Definitive assessment of prognostic features should be deferred to the excision specimen.

Comparative genomic hybridization shows no detectable chromosomal gains or losses. While the quality of the DNA that we extracted is not optimal, it is reasonable.  Most lesions of this type are well circumscribed. Hence, despite this result, I would still consider a slightly wider, but deeper (full thickness) reexcision to remove the remainder of the lesion and to make sure that a more atypical, deep component is not evident.","Sections show a domed, somewhat papillated segment of skin with a proliferation of large oval melanocytes that extends from the junctional zone to the base of the specimen in the superficial reticular dermis.

The best means to assess or refute this possibility is to complete array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis, which we pursued. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis did not reveal any chromosomal gains or losses. As you know, the vast majority of melanomas, including childhood-type melanomas, harbor various genomic anomalies.

Cell proliferation analysis was completed via immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system in which MART-1 is labeled red and Ki-67 is labeled brown. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. The MART-positive cells show increased nuclear expression of Ki-67, especially in the upper dermis, thus implying that cellular proliferation is elevated. This staining result was of potential concern but is not diagnostically decisive. In light of diagnostic ambiguity, we next pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis demonstrated gain in chromosome 11p. A small segmental loss in chromosome 14q was also noted. Gain in chromosome 11p is commonly found as an aberration in desmoplastic Spitz tumors with associated HRAS mutation.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH analysis points to interpretation as an unconventional (HRAS-mutated) Spitz nevus. This proliferation is focally transected at the periphery of the current specimen. Further excision is recommended to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.

Many features favor a Spitz's nevus, but there are large aggregations deep in the lesion, a few mitotic figures at the level of the mid-reticular dermis and the melanocytic nuclei are more pleomorphic than usual. Complete excision, despite the cosmetically sensitive area is warranted.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows a gain involving chromosome 11p, and also one involving 7q. Isolated 11p gain usually corresponds to the formation of an isochromosome (two copies of 11p joined by a centromere), and has not been seen to date in melanoma. Spitz's nevi with this aberration are likely to have a mutation involving h-ras, and to deeply infiltrate the reticular dermis as single cells, findings that are present here. In this case, the 11p gain is not isolated but is associated by a gain of 7q. I consulted with Dr. Boris Bastian, at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, a colleague whose laboratory developed diagnostic comparative genomic hybridization when he was here at UCSF. He has not seen these two aberrations together, and heretofore regarded them as mutually exclusive. He believes that the current CGH picture still favors Spitz's nevus, even though the 11p aberration is not an isolated one.

By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity and a low Ki-67 cell proliferation index.

A phosphohistone H3 immunoperoxidase stain (which labels melanocytes in mitosis) labels nuclei in the dermis, but these cells are mostly lymphocytes (that said, melanocytes in mitosis can be seen in conventional sections, so it is clear that cell proliferation was ongoing prior to biopsy). The aforementioned immunostaining results are inconclusive. We also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies.

To more fully address this differential, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 4, gain in distal chromosome 7q, loss of chromosome 9, and gain in chromosome 15q. The identification of multiple genomic gains and losses confirms the presence of genomic instability, which is confirmatory of a diagnosis of melanoma. As you probably know, the aCGH profile that has been demonstrated is incompatible with a diagnosis of melanocytic nevus. Please note that this melanoma would not be diagnosable via application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The current FISH approach that is utilized analyzes (and thus potentially demonstrates) aberrations involving only chromosomes 6 and 11. This melanoma, which has multiple aberrations involving other chromosomes, would have a normal FISH profile. (This is not uncommon in spitzoid melanomas.)  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as melanoma. This is a non-ulcerated melanoma with associated Clark's level IV invasion. The final microstage parameters should be reassessed once this melanoma has been fully extirpated.","Sections show a partial biopsy that contains a compound proliferation of enlarged melanocytes that are slightly spindled or epithelioid in morphology.

My experience is that lesions of this type seldom recur with 5 mm margins. Involvement of local lymph nodes is common, but distant metastasis is rare. We obtained comparative genomic hybridization on this case. There is a clear cut loss involving chromosome 1p, without other aberrations. Certain chromosomal gains and losses are typical of melanoma, but this is not one of them. Idiosyncratic ones such as those seen here may occur in so-called atypical Spitz tumors. In general, Spitz's nevi have gains of 11p alone, 7q alone, or no aberrations. Hence, the results are intermediate, and although abnormal are not interpretable as melanoma.  Dr. Boris Bastian, my colleague who developed diagnostic comparative genomic hybridization also reviewed the results of this test and agrees with this interpretation of it.","Sections show a dome-surfaced, somewhat wedge-shaped proliferation of large fusiform melanocytes that extends from the junctional zone into the subcutis.

Within the dermis, fascicles of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei that contain large nucleoli are present within fibrotic stroma. Clefts demarcate adjacent melanocytes from one another. Mitotic figures are rare, but at least one is present a short distance from the base of the lesion. The enclosed immunoperoxidase-stained sections include S100 and Melan-A stains that highlight the fascicular structure of the lesion, and HMB45 stain that shows some positivity throughout the entire thickness of the lesion, and a Ki-67 stain showing what appears to be an elevated proliferation rate (this is difficult to judge, as there are admixed lymphocytes).",F,5.0,,,,,

Given the clinical setting, we obtained comparative genomic hybridization. This shows multiple chromosomal aberrations, which in concert with the histopathologic findings favor interpretation as a spitzoid melanoma rather than as an unusual Spitz's nevus. These aberrations include losses involving most of chromosome 2 (with a gain of a smaller focus in the same chromosome), and gains involving chromosome 7q, 9p, 17q and 19p. Finding gains and losses in the same chromosome, as in chromosome 2 in this case is particularly suggestive of melanoma, as is the sheer number of aberrations; both point to a high degree of genomic instability. Some of the aberrations seen in this case are idiosyncratic (such as the gain in 9p; 9p is usually lost in melanoma) while others are characteristic of melanomas in adults (such as the gain in 7q). The lesion measures 2.2 mm in thickness, and may prove to be thicker on complete excision. Lesions of this type often involve sentinel lymph nodes, but the predictive value vis-a-vis extranodal metastatic spread is limited. If there are interesting or unusual findings in the reexcision specimen, I would be interested in viewing the sections as part of this consultation.","Sections show a somewhat asymmetrical, dome-surfaced proliferation of melanocytes with irregular epidermal hyperplasia in some areas and a relatively thin epidermis in others. Jagged rete ridges, hypergranulosis and a mixture of lamellar hyperkeratosis and compact hyperkeratosis are present.

Both large vesicular nuclei with large central nucleoli and hyperchromatic nuclei are present. Some maturation with descent is evident, and the aggregations near the base of the specimen are considerably smaller than those situated more superficially. Many multinucleated melanocytes are also seen. The accompanying immunoperoxidase-stained sections include a p16 stain in which most of the cells fail to react.

In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced clear support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, I believe this melanocytic proliferation represents an unconventional melanocytic nevus. This process is transected at the periphery of the current specimen. In light of this, further excision is recommended to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.","Sections show enlarged slightly spindled and epithelioid melanocytes arrayed in compound fashion. There are single melanocytes and nests and fascicles of melanocytes within the epidermis, which is partially acanthotic and hyperkeratotic, and limited intraspinous scatter is noted. There are also many small pink globules within the epidermis. The dermis below this holds maturing nests and fascicles in concert with fibrosis, and a juxtaposed sparse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate is also  noted.",M,36.0,,,,,

The thinned epidermis, mitotic rate and large, confluent nests in the superficial part of the lesion are all worrisome features. Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal losses including 8p, 9, 14 and 16. Several of these, most notably 8p and 9 are commonly lost in melanoma. Given these findings, despite the age of the patient, I believe that this lesion is best viewed as a spitzoid melanoma of childhood. I use this term for an emerging class of lesions that have a spitzoid morphology and a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. This makes sentinel lymph node biopsy less predictive than in adult melanoma. The thickness in this case is at least 1.8 mm as the lesion is transected. Thickness and prognosis are also not coupled in the same manner as in adult melanoma and the prognosis is also considerably better than with an adult lesion of the same thickness. Also, lesions of this type tend to be well circumscribed and excision margins can be considerably less.","There is a dome-surfaced proliferation of large oval melanocytes involving both the junctional zone of a thinned epidermis and the superficial dermis beneath it. Nests predominate over single cells along the junction. The lesional cells have abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and large oval vesicular nuclei with relatively small nucleoli. Many superficial dermal nests are extensively confluent or oddly shaped, and many mitotic figures are present, some of them atypical.

The overall histopathology of this case including enlarged melanocytes and scattered mitotic figures, one of which is atypical remains worrisome however, and the exact biologic potential of this lesion cannot be completely predicted.  Most larger series of this rare diagnostic category indicate that most patients are alive and well after treatment, which includes excision, and can include sentinel lymph node biopsy, (which may show metastatic foci).  Rare patients succumb to metastatic disease.  In this case, since the lesion extends to the edges of the specimen, a full thickness re-excision with a minimum of 5 millimeter margins is recommended.

To further address this differential, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic copy number anomalies, as per your request. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in distal chromosome 1q as well as focal gain and focal loss in distal chromosome 15q. This represents an ambiguous aCGH result. We have observed 15q gain in association with Spitz nevi, but the fact that multiple chromosomal gains and losses have been identified indicates that the interpretation is less than straightforward. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has yielded an ambiguous result.

Rather, our differential diagnosis included an atypical Spitz nevus on one hand and childhood-type spitzoid melanoma on the other. Cell proliferation analysis was completed via immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system in which MART-1 is labeled red and Ki-67 is labeled brown. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. The MART-positive cells show modestly elevated nuclear expression of Ki-67, thus implying that cellular proliferation is elevated. This staining result is of concern but is not specifically diagnostic. To more fully assess the nature of this proliferation, we also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed equivocal segmental loss in distal chromosome 8p with no other chromosomal gains or losses. As you probably know, most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The aCGH profile that we have defined here is not specific.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced clear support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, I favor an unconventional (or atypical) Spitz nevus as most likely. The proliferation abuts the specimen periphery in the available sections. In light of this, conservative complete reexcision of this site represents a follow-up step worthy of consideration.

To further substantiate the nature of this proliferation, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated chromosomal copy number aberrations. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed a tiny segmental gain in chromosome 7q with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. This is an aberration that we have identified in association with a small number of desmoplastic Spitz nevi. As you know, most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations.

In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma.

A zone of paucicellular fibrosis is present beneath part of the lesion, consistent with a scar. Immunoperoxidase stained sections prepared in our laboratory show that a small minority of cells are p16 positive. This finding is less common in nevi than in melanoma. Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a very low proliferation rate, which in contrast is a reassuring finding. Similarly, only rare cells are positive in a phosphohistone H3 immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle).

Per your request, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) assessment of this tumor to screen for melanoma-associated genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in chromosome 9 with equivocal segmental loss in chromosomes 7p and 8p. The identification of chromosome 9 loss represents an ambiguous aCGH result. We have identified chromosome 9 loss as a monoaberration in some melanomas, but we have also found chromosome 9 loss in proliferations in which the best expert microscopic interpretation was as a melanocytic nevus. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced an unequivocal diagnosis. Based solely upon conventional microscopy, I favor an unconventional deep penetrating melanocytic nevus as most likely. The results of our aCGH analysis have additionally raised melanoma of 1.6 mm in thickness as a diagnostic possibility. The proliferation appears excised in the available planes of section in the current specimen. Additional excision and ongoing clinical follow-up will be necessary in light of the fact that melanoma has now been raised as a distinct possibility in the differential diagnosis.","The submitted level sections demonstrate a sessile skin segment that harbors a dermal proliferation of melanocytes arrayed in nested, fascicular, and syncytial fashion. Near the junctional zone, epithelioid melanocytes with pale or finely melanized cytoplasm are arrayed in coalescing fashion, and subjacent to this there are coalescing fascicles of slightly spindled melanocytes with similar cytoplasmic qualities. As one extends more deeply in the dermis, the melanocytes become smaller with descent and occasionally are wrapped around tiny peripheral nerves or abut vascular channels. Extension into the subjacent reticular dermis is coupled with a marked diminishment in cell size and an interstitial distribution. Dermal melanocytes in mitosis are not easily found, and the Ki-67 cell proliferation index appears to be relatively low.",F,45.0,,,,,

There are multiple chromosomal gains and losses, some of them involving areas that are frequently aberrant in melanoma. The aberrations in this case include a loss involving 5q, a loss of 6qtr, chromosome 9, a complex rearrangement involving 11q with multiple gains and losses, a loss of 12p and a gain of 13. The pattern seen here overlaps with that found in a separate CGH reaction from DNA extracted from the bowel metastasis (see part D, below).","Sections show a broad based and asymmetrical proliferation of melanocytes involving the epidermis, papillary and superficial reticular dermis. There is a mostly junctional flatter area featuring discrete nests of melanocytes with abundant, pale lightly pigmented cytoplasm and small, monomorphous nuclei, and intervening basilar hyperpigmentation. The raised area features large, compact nests of melanocytes with small round to oval nuclei, small nucleoli and scattered mitotic figures. Some mature with descent is present, and smaller cells lie in between collagen bundles in the superficial reticular dermis and around blood vascular and lymphatic vessels.",F,20.0,,1.0,,,

Spitz's nevi with chromosome 11p gains are likely to have a mutation involving h-ras, and to deeply infiltrate the reticular dermis as single cells, findings that are present here.

Based solely upon conventional microscopical parameters, an unequivocal diagnosis is not possible. This is the type of challenging case for which comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) can be of value, and we proceeded with CGH analysis, as per your request. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed small segmental areas of gain and loss in chromosome 11q but other significant chromosomal gains or losses are lacking. Interestingly, these areas of anomalous genomic copy number do not involve the location of the CCND1 (cyclin-D1) gene, as might be seen in association with melanoma. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has yielded an ambiguous result. We have not identified microscopic findings or molecular aberrations that are conclusively diagnostic of childhood-type melanoma. Summing all of the available information, I favor an unconventional Spitz nevus as the best overall classification for this case.

After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 11p as well as focal gain and loss in chromosome 7q.

Losses of 9p are the most common aberrations in melanoma, and while not specific, when associated with other abnormalities point to that diagnosis.

The melanocytic proliferation has the overall architectural features of a dysplastic nevus, but has very large and confluent junctional nests, and a dermal component with some desmoplastic features. The differential diagnosis included an unusual dysplastic (Clark's) nevus and a dysplastic nevus-like pattern of melanoma.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows many chromosomal gains and losses, indicative of a level of genomic instability seen in melanoma and not in nevi. These included losses involving chromosome 3q, 8p, and 9p, and multiple areas of gains and losses on chromosome 11q. Losses of 9p are the most common aberrations in melanoma, and while not specific, when associated with other abnormalities point to that diagnosis.  The lesion is less than 1 mm in thickness, is not ulcerated, and does not have detectable mitotic figures in its dermal component. Therefore it should be classified as T1a per the 2009 revision of the AJCC staging system for melanoma.","There is a compound proliferation of melanocytes involving the epidermis and superficial dermis.

The extreme nuclear pleomorphism, with large bizarre nuclei, some containing macronucleoli and configuration of the lesion are findings by light microscopy against a conventional Spitz's nevus, or a well characterized variant. Morphologically, I favored designation as spitzoid melanoma of childhood. After discussion of the case with the child's dermatologist, Dr. Aimee Smidt, we have proceeded with comparative genomic hybridization. This showed multiple aberrations, consistent with melanoma. These included a set of aberrations involving chromosome 6p, with high level amplifications of the peri-telomeric and peri-centromeric areas, and a loss of the broader area in between them. Other losses include 8p, 11q and 19q, with a gain involving 19p.  The lesion is over 7 mm in thickness, which ordinarily would qualify this non-ulcerated neoplasm as stage T4 melanoma. While there is a propensity for lesions like this one to involve local lymph nodes, systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma.

To further evaluate for this differential diagnosis, I initially performed a phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle). The stain showed only a few melanocytes in mitosis or near to mitosis, which was reassuring.  Nonetheless, as an additional diagnositic maneuver, I performed comparative genomic hybridization on this case after receiving authorization from the clinical team who had discussed the testing with the family. This is a technique that assesses chromosomal gains or losses, which are found in melanoma and not in nevi.  The comparative genomic hybridization showed losses involving portions of chromosome 9p and 10q. The presence of two chromosomal losses is abnormal and supportive of melanoma. The melanoma measures 2.6 millimeter in thickness and is present in the tip margin. Therefore, by conventional AJCC melanoma staging guidelines, this would be considered a pT3a melanoma. However, given the spitzoid morphology of many of the cells, it is possible that this melanoma would behave in a less aggressive fashion compared with a conventional melanoma of equivalent thickness.

Favoring melanoma are the character of the cytoplasm of the lesional melanocytes and the degree of nuclear pleomorphism of both epidermal and dermal melanocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a low proliferation rate in the dermal component. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows some mitotic figures in the junctional component but not in the dermal component. Both of these are reassuring findings. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain shows nearly complete loss of that tumor suppressor gene product. Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal aberrations pointing to melanoma. There is a gain involving chromosome 1q, and losses involving chromosomes 9, 10 and the distal portion of 11q. The first three are common occurrences in melanoma. The low amplitude of the deviations from the baseline on the comparative genomic hybridization array graph probably reflects normal cell contamination, as the epidermis in the area that was used for comparative genomic hybridization is quite thick (DNA from normal keratinocytes and lymphocytes diluted the DNA from the lesional melanocytes).  The neoplasm extends to the peripheral edge of the specimen. The lesion is less than 1 mm in thickness, is not ulcerated, and does not have detectable mitotic figures in its dermal component.

By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. Similar to what was seen in your special stain, the MART-positive cells show low nuclear expression of Ki-67, thus implying that cellular proliferation is very low. This finding can be seen in association with melanocytic nevi but is not definitively diagnostic (a low cell proliferation index can also be seen in the context of nevoid melanoma). One of your original slides demonstrates multiple melanocytes in mitosis, and this finding proved to be worrisome for melanoma. To further clarify the nature of this tumor, we completed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as can be seen with melanoma. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosomes 1q and 7 as well as loss in chromosomes 9, 10q, and 22q. The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number abnormalities indicates genomic instability, as is stereotypical of malignancies such as melanoma. The genomic profile that we have defined excludes a melanocytic nevus from the differential diagnosis.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma. With respect to staging, this melanoma is less than 1 mm in thickness and lacks associated ulceration, yet melanocytes in mitosis are detectable in its invasive component. Therefore, this provisionally represents melanoma of stage pT1b (2009 AJCC Guidelines). The final microstage parameters can be reassessed once this melanoma has been fully extirpated.","Sections show a domed dermal proliferation of melanocytes arrayed as partially-maturing nests, cords, and small syncytia.

Your submitted immunostains demonstrate avid expression of HMB-45, as would be expected with a blue nevus or blue nevus-like melanoma. Cell proliferation analysis was completed via immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system in which MART-1 is labeled red and Ki-67 is labeled brown. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. The MART-positive cells show slightly elevated nuclear expression of Ki-67, thus implying that cellular proliferation is elevated, which is of potential concern. A p16 immunostain demonstrates preservation of expression, which implies that an underlying anomaly in chromosome 9p is not present. This is the type of challenging case for which array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can be applied to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as can be seen with melanoma. Per your request and approval, completed molecular assessment. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosomes 7, 8, and 22q. The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number aberrations indicates genomic instability, as is stereotypical of malignancies such as melanoma. The aCGH profile that we have defined is incompatible with a benign interpretation.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH demonstrates that this atypical melanocytic tumor represents melanoma that has developed secondarily in a blue nevus. This entity can be referred to as 'blue nevus-like melanoma'. With respect to staging, this melanoma is between 1-2 mm in thickness and lacks associated ulceration in the current sections. Therefore, it provisionally represents melanoma of stage pT2a (2009 AJCC Guidelines). The final microstage parameters can be reassessed once this melanoma has been fully extirpated.

This showed a loss of chr. 7p, and a gain involving chr. 15q. Gains, rather than losses of chr. 7p are common in melanoma. Gains of 15q can be seen in melanoma, but usually in concert with other aberrations.

Your submitted immunoperoxidase stains included a Ki-67 stain that demonstrates a low cell proliferation index. We additionally completed p16 and BAP-1 immunostains in our assessment. There is a marked loss of p16 expression, which implied that underlying loss in chromosome 9p might be present (this proved not to be the case, as is discussed further below). There is preservation of BAP-1 expression, and thus there is not an underlying anomaly in chromosome 3p. Per your approval, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as can be seen with melanoma. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed several contiguous areas of gain within chromosome 15q with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. (With specific reference to chromosome 9, no gain or loss was found.) We have observed gain in chromosome 15q as a monoaberration in a series of atypical Spitz (or pigmented spindle cell) nevi, and this genomic anomaly is not believed to be indicative of a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, we believe the gain is a consequence of NTRK3 gene rearrangement.  In summary, although I had reservations regarding the possibility of nevoid melanoma based upon conventional histopathologic findings, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH favors instead interpretation as an unconventional melanocytic nevus (or unconventional Spitz/Reed nevus).

To more fully assess this differential diagnosis and to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as can be seen with melanoma, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss of chromosome 6q and gain in chromosome 15q. (The loss in chromosome 6q includes the location of the MYB gene that is assayed as part of standard fluorescence in situ hybridization copy number analysis of melanocytic tumors.) No other substantive chromosomal copy number gains or losses were noted. The identification of multiple copy number abnormalities suggests genomic instability, as is typical of malignancies such as melanoma. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH favors interpretation as nevoid melanoma. With respect to staging, this melanoma is between 1-2 mm in thickness and lacks associated ulceration. Therefore, it represents melanoma of stage pT2a (2009 AJCC Guidelines). Further excision is warranted to ensure that local control has been established.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology. J Cutan Pathol. 2011; 38:323-5.","Sections show an asymmetrical compound proliferation of melanocytes that is distinctly biphasic in its composition. One population consists of melanocytes with small amounts of amphophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm. These cells are distributed singly and in many nests within the epidermis and focally within adnexa, and maturing nests, cords, and syncytia of similar melanocytes can be seen in the dermis below this. The second population of larger epithelioid melanocytes has pale, ballooned, or finely pigmented cytoplasm. These cells are distributed erratically along the junction and in pagetoid fashion within adnexa, and several large nests of these melanocytes are present in the dermis as well.

I favor the surface of a compound Spitz nevus, but some unconventional (or atypical) features are present, and the extent of subjacent dermal involvement cannot be evaluated because of the superficial nature of the biopsy. There are at least two ways to proceed in the management of this case. One is to complete conservative reexcision of this site and obtain any residuum for further histopathologic assessment. The other is to pursue comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to screen this tumor for chromosomal copy number abnormalities, as can be found in association with spitzoid melanoma. (The latter option was selected, as is discussed further below.) Per a clinical request, we completed CGH analysis to screen for genomic copy number anomalies. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in distal chromosome 7q with no other chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, please note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while most melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. We have identified gain in chromosome 7q as a monoaberration in a subset of unconventional Spitz nevi.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma. Rather, our analysis supports interpretation as an unconventional Spitz nevus. Given the complexity of this assessment, reexcision of this site would be reasonable to ensure local control and prevent persistence.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology. J Cutan Pathol. 2011; 38:323-5.","Sections show a domed compound proliferation of enlarged fusiform melanocytes with amphophilic cytoplasm.

To provide some context for the eventual findings, I performed a few immunostains. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows many nuclei with what appear to be mitotic figures in melanocytes in the lower half of the lesion. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product. Comparative genomic hybridization shows gains involving chromosomes 12p and 15q. This is an unusual result. I shared the comparative genomic hybridization data with my colleagues, Drs. Boris Bastian and Iwei Yeh. They do not regard these aberrations as indicating melanoma, as more typical ones would. There may be a gene fusion mechanism in this case, as has been seen with other spitzoid lesions in studies from their lab.  An atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have feature more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. If there are significant findings on re-excision, I would appreciate a chance to see the sections. Most lesions of this type are well circumscribed, and the re-excision should be deeper, but necessarily more than a few mms. wider that the prior biopsy site or an visible residuum.","There is a mostly intradermal proliferation of large, oval melanocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm and large, but monomorphous oval vesicular nuclei.

These are unusual melanocytic lesions with some features similar to those of blue nevus, but with a different genomic origin and the presence of some junctional nests. There are deep penetrating nevus-like melanomas, and in some controversies about the essential nature of this entity. Hence, I performed immunostaining. Immunostaining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a high proliferative rate in the lesional cells, with up to 30% of the cells in occasional nests having positively stained nuclei. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows only rare positive nuclei. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show loss of that tumor suppressor gene product.  Given the unusual features in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections (the degree of confluence of dermal aggregations, and the degree of nuclear pleomorphism), as well as the high proliferative rate noted above, one would ideally achieve unequivocally clear margins around such a lesion. The current margins are less than 0.2 mm.  Following our discussion, and the history of brain tumor followed by radiation, I have requested a p53 immunoperoxidase stain, as some neoplasms due to radiation have p53 mutations that stabilize the protein, and lead to immunohistochemical positivity. The staining is negative.  Comparative genomic hybridization did not show chromosomal gains or losses, a finding that is strongly against melanoma.","Sections show a compound, wedge-shaped proliferation of large oval melanocytes with  pleomorphic vesicular nuclei and abundant vacuolated cytoplasms, arranged as small nests and fascicles.

Rather, our differential diagnosis includes an unusual combined melanocytic nevus or unconventional Spitz nevus, an 'atypical Spitz tumor' (a provisional diagnostic category), and childhood spitzoid melanoma. We completed BAP-1 immunoperoxidase staining as part of our evaluation, as BAP-1 loss (within chromosome 3p) can be detected in a subset of Spitz tumors with enlarged epithelioid melanocytes, similar to those seen here. The BAP-1 immunostain demonstrates preserved nuclear positivity throughout, thereby indicating that BAP-1 loss is not present. This is the type of challenging tumor for which array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can be of value. This technique was applied, as per your approval. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in distal chromosome 7 with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. Gain in chromosome 7q suggests a Spitz nevus with associated MET genetic fusion. MET immunostaining was additionally completed and demonstrates positivity, thereby corroborating the possibility suggested in the preceding sentence.  This is an unusual melanocytic tumor.

These findings raised the possibility of a spitzoid melanoma. Comparative genomic hybridization shows chromosomal amplifications involving areas on 7p (near the terminal end) and 7q. The latter includes part of the b-raf gene. The fusion partner for b-raf in this case may be MAD1L1, a gene that has been seen as a fusion partner in other such cases. My colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh also reveiwed the comparative genomic hybridization data and agrees with this interpretation of it.  Spitzoid lesions with b-raf fusions lack b-raf mutations (i.e. the sequence of the gene is wild type, but there is a break in the gene and the chromosome is attached at the breakpoint to its fusion partner). This mechanism can occur in Spitz's nevi, atypical Spitz tumors and in melanoma. An overview of the subject of braf fusions is in the paper from our group referenced below. The absence of other abberations in this lesion, with the exception of a low level loss involving chromosome 14q is against an outright diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma.  An atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have feature more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.

Additionally, while the lesion appears to have a flat base at scanning magnification, that base is provided by lymphocytes. When one looks at the contour of the melanocytic proliferation itself, it is quite uneven. A p16 immunostain performed in our laboratory shows a near absence of staining. This can correlate with bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p. or chr. 9, but is not as strong evidence for the genomic loss as would be fluorescence in situ hybridization or comparative genomic hybridization testing. Currently, I use the term Spitzoid melanoma, childhood type, for an emerging class of lesions that usually but not exclusively occur in children and teens, usually lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas in adults) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. These are findings that would support conservative treatment. Most lesions of this type are deeper, but usually not much wider than their exophytic portions, and even when they are, are well circumscribed. While sentinel nodes are often positive, this positivity has much less predictive value for systemic spread than is the case with adult melanoma. Hence, the thickness of 2.1 mm would result in a prognosis that is much more grim than a lesion such as this one would ordinarily have. A narrow re-excision and clinical follow-up is preferable to more aggressive treatment.","There is a proliferation of large oval and fusiform melanocytes that are predominantly situated in the dermis, forming large confluent nests at the junction of an irregularly hyperplastic epidermis with a domed surface.

Some would term the current changes atypical blue nevus, a term I am not fond of but may have some applicability in this case. In keeping with this borderline character, comparative genomic hybridization shows an aberration not typically seen in melanoma. There is a gain involving chr. 9, which is often lost in melanoma. A re-excision of this area seems appropriate. In the reference below, the number of aberrations seen in blue nevus-like melanoma was higher than in atypical blue nevi or in conventional cellular blue nevi; with one aberration, and that one not typically associated with melanoma, this intermediate category seems best.

At the periphery of the mass are cords and strands of small, round cells with relatively scant pale cytoplasm and monomorphous oval nuclei containing small nucleoli. These cells are separated by thickened collagen bundles in some areas, with a few melanophages. The center of the lesion is more cellular. There are sheets of cells with inconspicuous pale cytoplasm and considerably larger, vesicular nuclei with moderately enlarged reddish nucleoli. Several mitotic figures are evident (but usually 1-2 per mm square). There are occasional multinucleated cells, as well as pseudovascular spaces within the masses of melanocytes. The enclosed immunostains include positive S100 and Melan-A stains, as well as an HMB-45 stain which marks both the smaller and larger melanocytes.",F,34.0,,,,,

Immunostaining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively high proliferation rate in the dermal component (about 10-15%). A p16 immunoperoxidase stain show a mosaic pattern of loss of that tumor suppressor gene product, an indeterminate pattern. Comparative genomic hybridization shows a gain involving chr. 2p, and a complex combination of gains and losses involving chr. 7q. The breakpoints suggest a gene fusion involving MET on chr. 7 and DTCN1 on chr. 2p, a combination that Dr. Iwei Yeh, who also viewed the comparative genomic hybridization data has previously noted. This may lead to upregulation of braf (near one of the other breakpoints on 7q), in the absence of braf mutation. While the absence of other chromosomal gains and losses is somewhat reassuring, it would be best to view this as a lesion with limited but non-zero metastatic potential, e.g. as an atypical Spitz. These are neoplasms that have feature more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.","There is a dome-surfaced compound proliferation of melanocytes featuring markedly elongated, jagged ridges and large oval and fusiform cells with variable amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei, amongst which mitotic figures can be discerned.

A synoptic report of potential prognostic factors is listed below:  Procedure: Punch biopsy Microscopic tumor type: Superficial spreading Breslow thickness:  0.95 mm Ulceration: Not present Margins, peripheral and deep: + peripheral; 5 millimeters from deep Mitotic index: < 1/mm2 Microsatellitosis: not evident Vascular invasion: None identified in a section stained with D2-40 Regression: Partial Pathologic staging (pTNM): pT1a, should no more adverse findings be evident on complete excision  My colleague, Dr. Timothy McCalmont, also reviewed these sections and agrees with this assessment.","Sections show a compound proliferation of melanocytes, some with atypical nuclei, arranged in some areas as nests along the sides and bases of elongated rete ridges, with fibroplasia of the papillary dermis.  In other areas, a more irregular distribution of melanocytes is present within the epidermis, and single melanocytes predominate over nests in some areas while scattered intraspinous melanocytes are apparent in some foci as well. Nests of melanocytes are present in the dermis as well, and some of the dermal melanocytes are large and have hyperchromatic nuclei. There are also areas in which the dermis is thickened and fibrotic, with a patchy bandlike lymphohistiocytic infiltrate that includes numerous melanophages and diminished numbers of melanocytes in such areas, when compared to the remainder of the lesion.",M,49.0,T1a,0.95,Superficial spreading,Primary,1.0

Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. These include a gain involving chr. 1q, loss of 2p with areas of gain involving 2q but a gain involving the terminal portion of that chromosome, loss involving 4q, and loss involving 9p. Several of these aberrations are commonly found in melanoma.  While formally, this is an AJCC stage pT1a lesion, the prognosis is in a group of cases of this type is even more favorable than in a group of adult patients with conventional AJCC stage pT1a lesions. Spitzoid melanomas in children have a considerably lower rate of extranodal disease. This lesion is well circumscribed and has a margin of about 1 mm. As local recurrence from incomplete excision is rare in lesions of this type, I would suggest a narrow re-excision to achieve 5 mm. margins. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is controversial in this type of case, with childhood spitzoid melanomas having a high rate of nodal involvment, but a much lower rate of extranodal spread. Hence, the prognostic value of the procedure is much less than in an adult patient, and the procedure can lead to overtreatment.","Sections show a proliferation of melanocytes involving the epidermis and papillary dermis. The span of the junctional component exceeds that of the dermal portion. The lesional melanocytes include many cells with large, irregularly shaped hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm.

Summing all of the available findings, we have defined a spitzoid melanocytic tumor that has epigenetic loss of p16 expression and that has an associated genomic monoaberration involving distal chromosome 7q. This combination suggests that this tumor does not represent childhood spitzoid melanoma but rather represents a partially transformed Spitz tumor ('atypical Spitz tumor'). Since the current biopsy is only partial in nature, reexcision of the remainder of this tumor will be necessary as follow-up care.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology. J Cutan Pathol. 2011; 38:323-5.  This report was reissued on December 10, 2014, after correcting a typographical error.

There are clusters of similar melanocytes in the underlying dermis.  Due to these unusual features, I sought to further evaluate this specimen via immunoperoxidase staining. Staining for BAP-1 did not show loss of nuclear staining, as would point to a mutation in that gene (present in a specific subset of Spitz's nevi and other spitzoid lesions). By contrast, there was loss of p16 staining among a subset of the junctional and dermal melanocytes, which can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasms, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16 is located.  Given the features on the routinely stained hematoxylin and eosin section, in concert with the partial loss of p16, a definitive diagnosis could not be reached based on these data. Therefore, after receiving authorization to proceed with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) testing, following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed CGH to further evaluate this proliferation.  The testing revealed gains of chromosome 7q and 10p. Otherwise, no significant abnormalities were detected. Interestingly, there were no abnormalities of chromosome 9p and thus the loss of p16 staining probably is not significant. The chromosomal abnormalities detected by the CGH study can be seen in atypical Spitz tumors, which is the category into which I would classify this lesion. The CGH results do not support the diagnosis of melanoma, since, in melanoma, there are usually many chromosomal abnormalities detected. Given that this atypical Spitz tumor has been narrow excised, I think that the site could be clinically monitored or a narrow re-excision could be performed. Both Drs. Boris Bastian and Philip LeBoit have reviewed this case and agree with this assessment.","Sections show a segment of acral skin with a compound melanocytic proliferation.  There are large polygonal, ovoid, and spindled melanocytes in nests separated by clefts from the overlying hyperplastic epidermis, and similar cells are present in collections in the dermis.

Immunostaining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively low proliferation index. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain shows partial retention of that tumor suppressor gene product. BAP-1 staining is also preserved (this can be lost in a subset of Spitzoid proliferations). To assess whether this may reflect an emerging class of Spitzoid neoplasms with genetic fusion events, I also examined ALK and NTRK-1 which are not overexpressed. For further assessment of this proliferation, to exclude the possibility of Spitzoid melanoma, I was interested in obtaining comparative genomic hybridization on this case. This is a technique that assesses chromosomal gains or losses, which (with the exception of a gain of 11p, and few other specific, less common aberrations) are found in melanoma and not in Spitz's nevus. Dr. Timothy McCalmont, also reviewed these sections and agreed with this assessment.  We subsequently received your message authorizing comparative genomic hybridization and this has now been completed. The results are unusual but do not support a diagnosis of melanoma, nor is there an 11p gain as in some Spitz's nevi. I asked my colleagues Drs. Bastian and Yeh, of our molecular unit, to analyze these findings further. There are a complex array of small gains and losses involving a portion of chromosome 7q mainly, and a loss of a portion of 12p. Such anomalies have not been characterized or associated with a specific melanocytic entity to date. Thus, an atypical nevus is likely. However, as there are aberrations and unusual histologic features, as above, re-excision of this site is warranted as noted in the initial report.","Sections show a compound proliferation of melanocytes, with nested and solitary melanocytes arrayed irregularly along the junction.  There are clusters and syncytia of melanocytes arrayed irregularly in the superficial dermis, which is fibrotic, and some melanocytes are larger.

A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product. However, an A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows several mitotic figures in the lower part of the lesion including one marginal mitosis. Given this, I suggested obtaining comparative genomic hybridization. This showed an interstitial loss involving chr. 3p, as well as a loss involving the terminal part of chr. 19p. The interstitial area in 3p includes the BAP-1 gene. The loss of chr. 19p is not one associated with melanoma.  The morphology is not stereotypic for a spitzoid lesion with BAP-1 loss. However, there is a predominant population of epithelioid melanocytes with pale cytoplasm, so it seems compatible.  Please also note that the junctional component of this lesion is at a margin, and that the lesional thickness is 4 mm. Local control with atypical Spitz tumor and spitzoid melanomas can be achieved with more narrow margins than conventional melanoma, and the metastatic risk is much less than that of a conventional melanoma of comparable thickness.","There is a mostly intradermal proliferation of large, oval melanocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm and large, vesicular nuclei. The lesion has a pedunculated contour. There are elongated rete ridges with basilar hyperpigmentation and increased numbers of single melanocytes toward the edge of the lesion. In its core, there are strands of large, oval melanocytes with fibrotic stroma.",M,19.0,,,,,

Given these concerning features, additional testing was performed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using four probes (to loci on 6p, 6q, 6cent and 11q) and two probes to chromosome 9 (cep9 and 9p21) to assess for CDKN2A loss. The four probe cocktail showed polyploidy which is an ambiguous result that can be seen in both melanomas and some Spitz nevi, while the chromosome 9 probes showed homozygous loss of 9p21. The latter finding in the context of the other findings in this case supports a diagnosis of melanoma. I have shared this case with my colleague Dr. Philip LeBoit who agrees with this interpretation.

These include loss involving chr. 3, loss involving chr. 5p with small gains in the peri-centromeric area of 5p, areas of gain and loss involving chr. 7p in a pattern suggesting chromothripsis, gain of 7q, loss of 8p, loss of 11q, and gains and losses of 21q. While the the individual loci are not stereotypically altered in melanoma, taken together the findings strongly favor that diagnosis, including the presence of chromothripsis.  The neoplasm extends to the base of the specimen.","There is a compound proliferation of melanocytes featuring a predominant population of large round to oval cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and dusty melanin, and moderately enlarged round nuclei. These are arranged as large and confluent nests at the junction, in some cases bridging adjacent ridges, and encased within dense fibrotic stroma in the center of the lesion (with a much less prominent junctional component in this area). The cells contrast with cords and strands of small round melanocytes in a looser configuration in one focus.",M,48.0,,1.2,,,

My previously-reported histopathologic analysis of this tumor remains in this report and is included in full below the line of asterisks that has been inserted (below). With respect to molecular assessment, after microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed segmental loss of chromosome 3p as a monoaberration with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that many melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The identification of chromosome 3p loss confirms that BAP-1 genomic loss has occurred in this tumor. There are a number of reasons why aCGH analysis could fail to identify additional copy number change in a component of melanoma, including an inherent lack of copy number change in the given tumor, the effects of contaminating normal cells, or sampling error. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has confirmed the presence of BAP-1 genomic loss. Analysis by aCGH has not demonstrated a molecular footprint that is diagnostic of melanoma, but I still believe a component of melanoma is present on histopathologic grounds.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology. J Cutan Pathol. 2011; 38:323-5.  *************************************************************************************************************************** Objectively, I believe the histomorphology in your submitted slides point to a diagnosis of nevoid melanoma ex melanocytic nevus. Your submitted phosphohistone immunostain labels melanocytes in mitosis, most of which appear to be intraepidermal in distribution. We additionally completed p16 and BAP-1 immunostains as part of our assessment. The p16 stain demonstrates partial loss of expression, and thus hemizygous loss of chromosome 9p may be present in this tumor. The BAP-1 stain demonstrates loss of nuclear positivity in a subset of large epithelioid cells within this polymorphic tumor, and this labeling result indicates that BAP-1 genomic loss has occurred. In short, I believe this biopsy demonstrates melanoma ex 'BAPoma'.  Deletions (or loss) in BAP-1 can be detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and the presence of genomic loss can also be inferred by the identification of loss of nuclear BAP-1 expression by immunoperoxidase staining, as has been demonstrated here. Loss of BAP-1 can be accompanied by mutations in the remaining BAP-1 allele, which can be somatically acquired or inherited (germline). Inherited mutations of BAP-1 have recently been associated with a new cancer susceptibility syndrome, which is characterized by the occurrence of multiple skin-colored papules in affected individuals, only a minority of which develop uveal or cutaneous melanoma. Affected family members have had many (5 to >50) of the clinically innocuous yet histopathologically distinct melanocytic tumors, whereas there were few melanomas, suggesting that malignant potential is very low. Independently, germline mutations of BAP-1 have also been reported to be associated with familial mesothelioma.  The significance of this tumor in this patient needs to be judged in the larger familial context. If this is a solitary papule in a patient with no other similar lesions, then the BAP-1 alteration may be sporadic. If this patient has multiple similar papules or if there are similar papules in other family members, then the possibility of an underlying syndrome (with germline mutation) may be deserving of further consideration. If there is clinical interest in further corroborating the above diagnosis by means of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), please let me know and we can proceed once authorization has been received.

Molecular assessment (the results of which are discussed below) was initiated on July 29, 2015. Data became available during the subsequent week, and my final interpretation of the molecular data was completed on August 7, 2015. As I have discussed with you, this biopsy demonstrates a configuration that fits with a diagnosis of 'NTRK1-oma', namely a Spitz nevus/tumor with associated NTRK1 gene fusion. NTRK1 immunohistochemistry has been completed and demonstrates remarkable positivity, and this labeling result implies that underlying NTRK1 gene fusion has occurred. Gene fusion is merely a mechanism of tumor development and does not provide information regarding clinical behavior, but my impression, based upon histopathologic characteristics, is that this tumor is only partially transformed and thus holds no adverse clinical implications.  Given the high clinical concern, we completed ancillary assessment to further substantiate the nature of this tumor. This was completed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as would be expected with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed no chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, I believe this tumor is unusual but essentially equivalent to a melanocytic nevus. Dr. Rosenman should follow the site to verify that no persistence ensues, if no reexcision is planned.  Please note that I have also retrospectively reviewed a 2012 biopsy from this patient as part of my evaluation. My retrospective diagnosis for the prior specimen is that it demonstrates a 'pagetoid' pigmented spindle cell nevus. Some tumors within the spectrum of pigmented spindle cell nevus are induced by NTRK1 gene fusion, and thus it is conceivable that this patient's prior tumor and current tumor are mechanistically related. We understand that the old tissue block has been exhausted, and thus no further testing in that regard will be possible.

IN THICKNESS",173719,172.7,"The features seemed in part to be a mixture of those of a Spitz's nevus and those of a superficial congenital nevus, but some raised the possibility of a nevoid melanoma, necessitating additional studies. As some Spitz's nevi with cells that have less cytoplasm than usual have NTRK1 gene fusions, I obtained that immunostain, but the strong staining seen in that situation is not present. A p16 immunostain shows that this tumor suppressor protein is retained only in a minority of cells, but these are distributed evenly, and not in a pattern suggesting loss of p16 in a clonal population, as could reflect bi-allelic loss of CDKN2A as would favor melanoma. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) has now been repeated (the first try resulted in a slide in which much of the tissue had fallen off), and shows a marginal mitosis as well as one in the mid-portion of the lesion.  Marginal mitoses are mentioned in the reference below as a finding favoring melanoma over Spitz's nevus, and also emerged in the results of an expert panel in 2008 evaluating melanocytic neoplasms of unknown malignant potential.  Given this finding, I suggested comparative genomic hybridization, which has now been completed. It shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. These include loss of chr. 1p, chr. 2, gain of 4q, loss of 5, gain of 6p and loss of 6q, gains of 7 and 8, losses of 9 and 10, loss of 13, gain of 15, loss of 16 and gain of 19. Many of these are copy number changes often found in melanoma.  A recent study from St. Jude's Medical Center, referenced below suggests that hTERT mutation analysis is more important than chromosomal copy number changes in determining the potential for childhood spitzoid melanomas to spread beyond local nodes. In this case, this may not be as important, as the morphology is more nevoid than spitzoid. This testing is not commercially available, but we hope to have it set up in our lab in several months time.

One population was composed of relatively small epithelioid melanocytes that diminished in size with descent and that were located mostly at the periphery of the proliferation. The other population was composed of large epithelioid melanocytes, many with atypical nuclei and some in mitosis, that formed large nests and near sheets within the central aspect of the specimen. This central population of melanocytes was concerning for Spitzoid melanoma while the peripheal population was suggestive of a Spitz nevus. In order to further evaluate this neoplasm, I performed immunoperoxidase staining. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) demonstrates a non-trivial number of melanocytes in mitosis within the dermal component of this proliferation.  Staining with p16 demonstrates significant loss of p16 staining among melanocytes within the central aspect of the proliferation (i.e. those concerning for Spitzoid melanoma) but no loss in the peripheral melanocytes. This loss can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasm, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16, is located. This loss of staining can also occur by epigenetic means, and is not entirely specific for melanoma. Nonetheless, detection of this loss within the morphologically atypical melanocytes is concerning. While I favored a Spitzoid melanoma arising in a Spitz nevus for the above mentioned reasons, I did not think that an unequivocal diagnosis could be rendered based on the above data. Therefore, after receiving authorization from the clinical team, I (1) completed FISH analysis for chromosome 9p in order to determine if the loss of p16 staining mentioned above represented an authentic mutation in this genetic locus of an epigenetic phenomenon and (2) completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) since FISH analysis only tests for one genetic locus.  The FISH testing did not show homozygous loss of chromosome 9p and thus the loss of p16 appears to be an epigenetic phenomenon.  The aCGH reveals a small sub-centromeric gain on chromosome 1q, a loss on chromosome 6q and a gain of chromosome 21q. The loss on chromosome 1 is bordered by TPM3, which is a gene involved in a range of fusions, and thus it is possible that a fusion has occurred. While the presence of these three abnormalities detected on the aCGH is worrisome, it is not sufficiently atypical to render an unequivocal diagnosis of Spitzoid melanoma. I think it is best to regard this lesion as representing an atypical Spitz tumor, which is a Spitzoid neoplasm that shows more atypicality than a conventional Spitz tumor but is not sufficiently atypical to warrant an unequivocal diagnosis of Spitzoid melanoma. Fusions occur relatively frequently in atypical Spitz tumors, which might have been the case herein.  Given that this proliferation extends to the base and peripheral aspect of the specimen, I think that it should be re-excised with a few millimeters of a margin.  My colleagues, Dr. Timothy McCalmont and Boris Bastian, also reviewed these sections and agree with this assessment.","Sections show a compound proliferation of spitzoid melanocytes.

The repeat p16 stain was again negative, while the NTRK-1 immunostain demonstrated significant positivity, and thus underlying NTRK-1 gene fusion may be present. Given the histopathologic findings and the above immunostaining results, the differential diagnosis included a so-called 'atypical Spitz tumor' and spitzoid melanoma. To enable full characterization, we next completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as would be expected with melanoma.

In short, the molecular findings we have defined are incompatible with interpretation as a melanocytic nevus.

Your submitted immunostains demonstrate that p16 expression is generally preserved, which is in keeping with interpretation as a melanocytic nevus. That said, given the presence of deep mitotic figures in this tumor, we found it difficult to fully exclude pediatric melanoma from the differential diagnosis on strictly histopathologic grounds. In light of this, I recommended molecular analysis via either comparative genomic hybridization or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as would be expected with melanoma. After receipt of payor authorization, we proceed with array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss of distal chromosome 5q as a monoaberration with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses (there is also equivocal gain in chromosome 7p, but this is a distinctly subthreshold finding). As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The identification of a monoaberration, and in particular a monoaberration involving chromosome 5q, does not provide support for a molecular diagnosis of melanoma.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a molecular diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, our combined histopathologic and molecular findings support interpretation as an atypical melanocytic nevus (or as a 'partially transformed' tumor). As this biopsy is only partial in nature, reexcision of this site is indicated as follow-up management, if that has not yet been done. The intent of reexcision is simply to ensure complete removal and verify that persistence with additional transformation cannot ensue.

The cells of interest avidly express NTRK1, and this labeling result corroborates that NTRK1 gene fusion has occurred. ALK immunostaining is negative, and thus there is no indication of ALK gene fusion. A p16 immunostain demonstrates mosaic immunopositivity, and thus biallelic loss of chromosome 9p has not occurred. As you probably know, total loss of p16 expression can be considered a concerning immunohistochemical finding, but that is not present here. Kinase gene fusion, including ALK and NTRK1 gene fusion, represents a not uncommon mechanism of induction of Spitz nevi. Such tumors are only partially transformed and thus are self limited in behavior.

The cells of interest are positive with S100 protein, in keeping with a schwannoma, but an epithelial membrane antigen positive capsule is not present with that stain. Also, there are no cellular (Antoni A) and myxoid, less cellular (Antoni B) areas, and a small focus features melanophages. Neurofilament protein immunostaining is negative, unlike the case in palisaded and encapsulated neuroma (which should also have an EMA positive capsule). There is focal positivity with two melanocytic markers, Melan-A and HMB45. The latter is positive in fewer cells than would be expected in a cellular blue nevus. A p16 stain shows large areas with only a few positive cells, and some with none, worrisome for melanoma. A focally elevated Ki-67 cell proliferation index is present. ALK was obtained, given the long fascicles, but is negative (unlike the case in spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms with ALK gene fusions). A p53 immunoperoxidase stain does not show aberrant expression. Mutation of TP53 and overexpression of p53 is uncommon in primary melanomas in general, but occurs in many desmoplastic melanomas, which some aspects of this case raised.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple aberrations, including a gain involving chr. 2q, gains involving chr. 4p, gains and losses involving chr. 9, and a gain involving chr. 15q. The loss involving chr. 9 includes two levels in the CDKN2A area, suggesting a homozygous loss, worrisome for melanoma; there may also be a rearrangement involving NTRK3. The genomic data were also reviewed by my colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh.  Given these results, I believe that this neoplasm should be treated in a manner adequate for a low grade melanoma/melanocytic tumor of unknown malignant potential, with complete excision (the lesion in these sections is an oval mass with essentially positive margins around much of it.",There is a well-circumscribed oval mass composed of spindled cells with monomorphous nuclei and inconspicuous cytoplasm disposed as relatively closely apposed fascicles.,M,29.0,,,,,

IN THICKNESS",173305,172.3,"This proliferation of spitzoid cells shows large bulbous aggregations extending into the subcutis, as can be seen both in atypical Spitz tumors and spitzoid melanoma. There are mitotic figures in the deep portion of the lesion, including some so-called marginal mitoses. As there are thin, pointed ridges and long, vertically oriented fascicles, I suggested an ALK immunostain (along with p16). The stained sections have now been received. The ALK stain is negative, excluding that variant of spitzoid neoplasm. There is a mosaic pattern of staining for p16, sufficient to exclude the possibility of a bi-allelic deletion of chr. 9p, which can be found in melanoma (the absence of which does not exclude the diagnosis, however).  The differential diagnosis included an atypical Spitz tumor and spitzoid melanoma.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. These included gains involving chromosomes 2p, 3p, 4p, and 8q and losses involving 3q and 4q. C-myc is on chr. 8q, and gains of this chromosome are a repeatable aberration in melanoma, while many of the other aberrations are not.  Currently, I use the term spitzoid melanoma, childhood type, for an emerging class of lesions that usually but not exclusively occur in children and teens, lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas in adults) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. These are findings that would support conservative treatment. Most lesions of this type are deeper, but usually not much wider than their exophytic portions, and even when they are, are well circumscribed. While sentinel nodes are often positive, this positivity has much less predictive value for systemic spread than is the case with adult melanoma.  We will contact you if testing for hTERT promoter mutations again becomes available in our lab.  ADDENDUM, June 29, 2016:  Per my discussion with Dr. Dohil, we will be performing hTERT promoter mutation analysis; please expect results in 2-3 weeks.  ADDENDUM, July 13, 2016:  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Hence, even though the designation spitzoid melanoma may be apt morphologically, the prognosis would be expected to be better than in conventional melanomas of this thickness.

Rather, it demonstrates characteristics that are typical of a variant of Spitz nevus, namely a Spitz nevus with underlying NTRK1 gene fusion. Immunostaining with NTRK1 has been completed and demonstrates avid positivity, and this labeling result corroborates that NTRK1 gene fusion is present. We additionally completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for copy number loss as a means to fully exclude melanoma from the differential diagnosis. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed a slightly noisy tracing (with possible/equivocal subthreshold loss in chromosome 19) with no significant chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. There is a small segmental loss in chromosome 1q at the location of the NTRK1 gene, and it seems likely that this is a consequence of gene fusion. The gene fusion partner cannot be identified by means of the aCGH technique.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, our results substantiate the diagnosis of Spitz nevus with underlying kinase gene fusion. Please note that this melanocytic tumor involves the edge of the biopsy, and thus conservative complete reexcision of this site can be considered as follow-up management. The intent of reexcision is simply to ensure complete removal and verify that persistence with additional transformation cannot ensue.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology.

Following the above DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization, and found losses involving chrs. 9 and 10. These are commonly found in melanoma. The chr. 9 loss appears to be heterozygous, as p16 is preserved by immunohistochemistry. Putting this all together, the maturation and dispersion with descent, and absence of hTERT promoter mutation are against a fully malignant neoplasm while the comparative genomic hybridization result somewhat favors melanoma, but not as much as if there was a homozygous chr. 9 or 9p loss.  An atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.

Most of the melanocytes have spindled nuclei with amphophilic cytoplasm. Given the long, vertically oriented fascicles in the dermis, I obtained NTRK-1 and ALK immunoperoxidase stains. These genes can be involved in a gene fusion, with resultant overexpression in a subset of Spitz's nevi with this morphologic finding. The stains are negative in this case, however. The differential diagnosis includes an atypical pigmented spindle cell nevus or plexiform spindle cell nevus, atypical Spitz tumor, and spitzoid melanoma. Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) does not show significant pagetoid scatter in the MART-1 component beyond what was evident in the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, and the Ki-67 proliferation rate of the lesional melanocytes is around 5%. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product. Given the ambiguous findings in the routine sections and immunoperoxidase workup, I obtained comparative genomic hybridization to assess for melanoma associated chromosomal abnormalities. This showed multiple chromosomal gains and losses including 1p and 8q loss, 7p and 15q gain, a complex pattern of both gains and losses on 7q including findings that suggest a BRAF fusion event, and an isolated interstitial deletion involving a portion of chromosome 3p containing the BAP-1 gene. Analysis for a tert promoter mutation was negative.  Given the genetic findings of multiple chromosomal gains and losses, including regions frequently seen in melanoma, I believe the best diagnosis for this case is a spitzoid melanoma and not an atypical Spitz tumor.

Some unusual features present here include many pulverocytes* in the upper part of the lesion, and several mitotic figures in the mid-dermal portion, as well as a notched lesional undersurface. While I favored an atypical Spitz tumor, I wanted to obtain comparative genomic hybridization to assess chromosomal copy number changes. This was approved by the insurance carrier.  A recent study (see reference below) suggests that hTERT promoter mutation status may be even more predictive of aggressive behavior in atypical spitzoid neoplasms than are chromosomal copy number changes.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows only a gain on chromosome 7q, with an area of loss of the terminal part of 7q. The breakpoint for the 7q gain is at the braf locus, as can be seen in lesions with wild type b-raf, but a gene fusion involving b-raf and another partner. b-raf gene fusions can occur in both some Spitz's nevi and atypical Spitz tumors and in some melanomas. Most melanomas with these fusions have other aberrations as well, which are absent here.  I favor an atypical Spitz tumor with a b-raf fusion, but would still favor obtaining a study to determine hTERT promoter status.

Phosphohistone-H3 staining demonstrates that the mitotic index is significantly elevated (4 per square millimeter). BAP-1 expression is preserved, and thus a so-called 'BAPoma' has been excluded from the differential diagnosis. Immunostaining with p16 demonstrates partial mosaic immunopositivity; since there is significant loss of expression in a superficial nodular area, we additionally completed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to better assess the copy number status of the CDKN2A locus. No copy number loss was identified in the CDKN2A FISH assessment, and this implies that the loss of p16 expression documented by immunohistochemistry is probably epigenetic in nature (and thus it cannot be taken as being diagnostically meaningful). Given the elevated mitotic index, my differential diagnosis included an ambiguous/indeterminate Spitz tumor on one hand and pediatric spitzoid melanoma on the other. The best current means to comprehensively evaluate the nature of a proliferation such as this one is to complete array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for copy number anomalies throughout the genome. After receipt of payor authorization, we thus initiated aCGH assessment. This consisted of microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block and application of aCGH, which demonstrated gain in chromosome 4p as well as loss in chromosomes 4q, 5q, 9q, 16q, and 22q. The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number abnormalities indicates genomic instability, as is stereotypical of melanoma.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has provided support for a diagnosis of pediatric spitzoid melanoma. The AJCC staging parameters that are applied to the assessment of adult melanoma are not known to be reflective of prognosis in the pediatric setting. With that said, for the sake of completeness, please note that this relatively thick tumor is non-ulcerated. As noted above, the mitotic index is 4 per square millimeter. The margin of excision is narrow in the available sections.

There is nearly complete loss of p16 staining, which can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasm, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16 is located. This loss of staining can also occur by epigenetic means, and is not entirely specific for melanoma. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a gain involving chr. 2, and losses involving chrs. 6q and 9. The depression in the CGH array graph suggests heterozygous rather than homozygous chr. 9 loss. Losses of chrs. 6q and 9 are common aberrations seen in atypical Spitz tumors and in melanoma, but not in conventional Spitz's nevi.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations.  Based on these findings, I favor an atypical Spitz tumor. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. The lesion is broadly transected, and a re-excision (not much wider- I would suggest 5 mm. or so around the prior biopsy site or any residuum), but deeper)  Reference:  Lee S, Barnhill RL, Dummer R, Dalton J, Wu J, Pappo A, Bahrami A.

The stain was performed as some blue nevus-like melanoma show BAP-1 loss due to mutation in one allele and loss of part or all of chromosome 3p or chr. 3. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product (nearly complete or complete loss in a defined zone is worrisome for melanoma).  I did not find mitotic figures in dermal melanocytes in a phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunostain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle), a finding against melanoma. The stain did show a minor junctional component and a few melanocytes scattered singly above the junction, against a cellular blue nevus.  Given this latter finding, I favor an unusually mitotically quiescent melanoma, and advise re-excision on that basis, despite the difficulties at this site. The thickness in these sections is problematic, given that only a tiny portion of epidermis is included, and the pieces are not optimally oriented. I estimate the thickness as about 2 mm.

ADDENDUM, May 31, 2016:  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. It shows an interesting array of aberrations, including evidence of a complex pattern of chromosomal fragmentation and re-jointing of chr. 7q, a loss involving chr. 10p and the pericentromeric area of 10q, two narrow areas of gain on chr 15 within the TRPM1 and MYO5A genes, respectively, a loss involving chr. 21q, and gain involving the pericentromeric area of chr. 22p with a breakpoint at the MAPK1 gene. Of these, chr. 10 loss if often found in melanoma, and complex chromosomal rearrangments like the one involving chr. 7q also point to melanoma. MAPK1 gain is present in only 1.5% of melanomas, with an unknown percentage having a focussed gain involving a narrow area around the gene. Whether the gains involving TRPM1 and MYO5A, both of which are involved in melanocytic tumor progression are significant or not is unknown.  The reporting of this case was delayed, as I wanted to go over the comparative genomic hybridization data with my colleagues, Dr. Boris Bastian and Iwei Yeh.","Sections show acral skin with large, oval nests of large, oval melanocytes with abundant, pale cytoplasm and monomorphous oval vesicular nuclei, within fibrotic stroma and with relatively evenly distributed melanophages.",M,80.0,,2.5,,,

A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product (nearly complete or complete loss in a defined zone is worrisome for melanoma).  Given the prominent fascicles, I obtained an ALK immunoperoxidase stain. The ALK gene can be involved in a gene fusion, with resultant overexpression in a subset of Spitz's nevi with this morphologic finding. The stain is negative in this case, however.  Staining for BAP-1 did not show loss of nuclear staining, as would point to a mutation in that gene (present in a specific subset of Spitz's nevi and other spitzoid lesions).  A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows scattered positive nuclei, some well within the lesion.  Given that the lesion is broad and does not have a typical pattern for either a conventional Spitz's nevus or one identifiable as associated with a common spitzoid gene fusion, I obtained comparative genomic hybridization, and Medi-Cal authorized this testing. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed CGH. which showed a high level gain of chr. 7q. An interstitial gain involving a gene, CDH19 was also identified. We have seen gains of 7q, which contains braf in some Spitz's nevi and atypical Spitz tumors.  An atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. If there is a significant residuum on re-excision, I would appreciate a chance to see the sections.

I have not encountered this, and asked my colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian, who developed the FISH test for melanoma, for his comments. He was skeptical of this result, and suggested that the testing was done on sections that were too thin. Otherwise, the findings appear to be those of a Spitz's nevus with a characteristic domed surface, wedge shaped base and diminishing cellularity toward the base of the lesion. The retention of p16 is a reassuring finding. A zone of granulation tissue implying a prior biopsy site is present, with a limitation of this evaluation being that if so, the sections from the biopsy are not included.  The margins appear clear in the planes of section examined.  We then tried to verify or refute the presence of chromosomal copy number changes by comparative genomic hybridization, per your message.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. It shows an isolated gain involving chromosome 11p, but no other aberrations, implying that the impression of hemizygous deletions was artifactual. Isolated 11p gain usually corresponds to two copies of 11p joined by a centromere, and has not been seen to date in melanoma.

A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product (nearly complete or complete loss in a defined zone is worrisome for melanoma).  Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively low proliferation rate in the junctional component and a moderately elevated proliferation rate in a mid-portion of the dermal component. The MART-1/tyrosinase component does not reveal more suprabasilar scatter than could be seen in the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections.  The findings are peculiar, and in another setting, I would consider complete excision. There may be a role for adjunctive testing, and follow up rather than excision if the results point to a benign lesion. I would be happy to discuss this with you.  ADDENDUM, July  6, 2016:  Per your message, we will proceed with comparative genomic hybridization. Results are usually available in 3-4 weeks.  ADDENDUM #2, July 30, 2016:  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a gain involving an area on distal chr. 7q, with a breakpoint within the b-raf gene. We have seen this pattern in Spitz nevi with braf gene fusions (e.g. fusions of b-raf with another partner on the same chromosome). These fusions activate b-raf transcription, and are much rarer than are b-raf mutations. While b-raf gene fusions can occasionally occur in melanoma, these are very rare and would be expected to be accompanied by other chromosomal copy number changes. Also, the morphology of some of these cases has had single melanocytes permeating the deep reticular dermis similar to the appearance here.  The neoplasm extends to the base of the specimen. Given this result by comparative genomic hybridization, I favor an unusual nevus with some spitzoid features. I believe that the site could be periodically followed.","Sections show a compound proliferation of melanocytes arrayed as a few small nests along the epidermal-dermal junction, and as nests, cords and strands that extend into the superficial reticular dermis and are distributed around adnexa.

Rather, this tumor shows many histopathologic features that were considered worrisome for nevoid melanoma with pseudomaturation. The gargantuan nests of melanocytes that are present superficially and the elevated mitotic index are both features that were considered to be of concern. I additionally considered the possibility of an epidermotropic metastasis of melanoma in my differential diagnosis. However, that would only be germane in the context of a patient with an existing history of melanoma and thus can be excluded in the interpretation of this specimen. To add additional diagnostic information, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss, as can be seen in association with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 11p as well as loss in chromone 22q with no other associated genomic gains or losses. Loss in chromosome 22q is a rare molecular finding and is likely of no larger significance. Gain in chromosome 11p has been identified in a subset of Spitz tumors and is highly correlated with underlying HRAS mutation.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH suggests that this proliferation represents an HRAS-mutated Spitz tumor rather than a frank melanoma. What is unusual about this case is that the microscopic findings are quite different from most examples of that entity. With that said, the molecular findings seem clear cut. Long-term follow-up studies of HRAS-mutated Spitz tumors suggests that they are functionally benign and thus are of no larger clinical significance. As the deep edge of this biopsy is involved, conservative reexcision is recommended to be certain that full local removal has been accomplished.

Your submitted immunostain for p16 shows partial loss of expression, and this finding is diagnostically inconclusive (although a loss of chromosome 9 was ultimately confirmed to be present, as is discussed in the paragraph that follows). To further evaluate this tumor, we completed phosphohistone-H3 immunostaining to assess the mitotic index. In the resultant immunostain, rather dramatic maturation is apparent, and only a small number of perijunctional melanocytes in mitosis can be identified. To clarify the differential diagnosis, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosomes 12p and 15q as well as loss in chromosomes 1p, 2p, centromeric 7p, 9, centromeric 12q, 13q, 17, and 18. The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number abnormalities indicates genomic instability, as is typical of melanoma.

Given the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and the sheet-like growth pattern, I proposed that molecular testing would be advantageous to see if chromosomal copy number changes, as seen in melanoma are present here. I had also proposed hTERT promoter mutation analysis, but my understanding is that insurance has denied coverage for this test. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows losses involving chr. 9, 13 and 18q, and a possible loss of the peri-centromeric area on chr. 10p. Losses involving chromosomes 9 and 10 are common in melanoma. The loss involving chr. 9 was not accentuated in the area of 9p that contains CDKN2A, making it unlikely that there is a homozygous deletion. This correlates with the preservation of p16 staining by immunohistochemistry.  Given the ulceration, histopathologic findings and the results of comparative genomic hybridization, I would regard this as a relatively high risk atypical Spitz tumor, if not spitzoid melanoma. It would be advantageous to also have the results of hTERT promoter testing.","There is an ulcerated, mostly intradermal proliferation of large, oval and fusiform melanocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm and large, vesicular nuclei.

Immunostaining demonstrated mosaic expression of p16, and thus biallelic loss in CDKN2A is not present in association with this tumor (the fact that there is not CDKN2A loss at all was subsequently documented by molecular methods, as is discussed in the paragraph that follows). An ALK stain is negative, and thus underlying ALK gene fusion is not present. My residual differential included an HRAS-mutated desmoplastic Spitz nevus, and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was completed to fully clarify the diagnosis. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 11p as a monoaberration with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The identification of gain in chromosome 11p is highly correlated with HRAS mutation, and this finding corroborates the diagnosis of HRAS-mutated Spitz nevus.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, our analysis confirms that this represents a variant of Spitz nevus, namely a Spitz nevus with HRAS mutation and gain. With respect to management, the inked edge of the specimen is focally involved, and thus conservative complete reexcision can be considered as a means to prevent persistence.

There are enough interspersed cells still present that I doubt that this represents a focus in which there is homozygous CDKN2A loss. While the overall size and cellularity of this lesion are daunting, the maturation and dispersion with descent, and flat base are reassuring findings. Despite the difficult site, a re-excision would be wise. We can provide additional confirmation by hTERT promoter mutation analysis, comparative genomic hybridization or both. ADDENDUM, November 11, 2016:  Per Dr. Rao's request, we will proceed with testing.  ADDENDUM, December  1, 2016:  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a gain and an loss on chr. 7q, and a loss involving chromosome 9. While chromosomes 9 loss is common in melanoma, it can be seen as an isolated finding, or along with chromosomal copy number changes affecting less significant sites in some partially transformed lesions. The changes on chr. 7q signify a b-raf rearrangement (not mutation, but fusion of the wild type gene) as can be seen in a subset of spitzoid lesions.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  Taking these findings into account together with the histopathologic findings, an atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. A narrow re-excision still seems warranted.   Reference:  Lee S, Barnhill RL, Dummer R, Dalton J, Wu J, Pappo A, Bahrami A.

A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows a few mitotic figures in the upper part of the lesion and one near its base, the latter a worrisome finding.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows losses involving chromosomes 9 and 14. While chromosomes 9 loss is common in melanoma, it can be seen as an isolated finding, or along with chromosomal copy number changes affecting less significant sites in some partially transformed lesions. Chr. 14 loss is not characteristic of melanoma.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  Taking these findings into account together with the histopathologic findings, an atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. The neoplasm extends to the base of the specimen, and a narrow re-excision still seems warranted.   Reference:  Lee S, Barnhill RL, Dummer R, Dalton J, Wu J, Pappo A, Bahrami A.

Based upon the findings in both, my differential diagnosis included a cellular blue nevus with perijunctional hypercellularity, an atypical cellular blue nevus, and blue nevus-like melanoma. Please note that the most atypical portion of the entire process is the hypercellularity seen in the perijunctional zone in the initial biopsy. Your p16 stain demonstrates generally preserved expression. Immunostaining for BAP-1 and phosphohistone-H3 was additionally completed, and the BAP-1 stain demonstrates preserved nuclear expression while the phosphohistone-H3 stain demonstrates that the mitotic index is low (<1 per square mm). These immunoperoxidase findings do not provide clear support to interpretation as melanoma and fit better with interpretation as an atypical melanocytic nevus.  Molecular assessment via array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was recommended and has now been completed. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed a focused loss in chromosome 4q and subthreshold gain in telomeric chromosome 9q with no other additional chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The two tiny aberrations that we have identified are not of diagnostic significance and are not known to be associated with blue nevus-like melanoma.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, our analysis fits with interpretation as an atypical cellular blue nevus. The tumor has been excised by means of the second specimen in this sequence, an no additional surgery at this site is recommended.

To fully delineate the genomic profile of this atypical proliferation, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss throughout the genome. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed subthreshold loss in chromosome 9p coupled with low amplitude loss in chromosome 6q and low amplitude gain in chromosome 15q. As all of the molecular findings are of low amplitude, the observed results do not support interpretation as frank spitzoid melanoma. The most significant finding is loss in chromosome 9; this can be seen in melanoma as well as in histopathologically ambiguous proliferations within the spectrum of 'atypical Spitz tumor'. I believe the latter categorization represents the best classification for this proliferation. The low amplitude changes observed within chromosomes 6q and 15q may be an indication of partial transformation by a subpopulation of melanocytes.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH do not support interpretation as frank spitzoid melanoma. Rather, I believe this histopathologically ambiguous proliferation is best categorized as an atypical Spitz tumor.

Per your authorization, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was also applied to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss throughout the genome. After microdissection of the key area of the tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, the application of aCGH revealed gain in centromeric chromosome 1p, loss in telomeric chromosome 1q, gain and loss in chromosome 7q with associated chromothripsis, and loss in chromosome 9. A marked focal gain in chromosome 7q is apparent at the location of BRAF, and this is probably an indicator of BRAF gene fusion.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with immunohistochemistry and aCGH suggests that frank spitzoid melanoma is not present here. Rather, we have identified an emerging spitzoid clone characterized by loss in CDKN2A and BRAF gene fusion. The secondary clone is best categorized as an 'atypical Spitz tumor', and the case as a whole can be viewed as an 'atypical Spitz tumor' arising focally within a Spitz nevus. With respect to management, the tumor appears narrowly excised in the current planes of section. Clinical follow-up of the surgical site is warranted, at a minimum (to verify that no persistence ensues), and additional excision can also be considered to ensure local removal.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology.

In the available level sections, small numbers of melanocytes are positioned at the junction and along the junction of adnexal epithelium to the dermis, but most melanocytes are intradermal in distribution. Some of the constituent cells are extremely large with plasmacytoid or epithelioid morphology.

A BAP-1 immunostain labels the nuclei of keratinocytes in the overlying epidermis, those of lymphocytes and those of the smaller melanocytes, but not the larger, spitzoid ones. This is consistent with BAP-1 loss in the larger spitzoid cells. This loss can be due to mutation in one allele and loss of the other, or to epigenetic mechanisms.  A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product (nearly complete or complete loss in a defined zone is worrisome for melanoma). As loss of p16 can follow BAP-1 loss in multi-step progression toward melanoma, this is a reassuring finding.  A phosphohistone H3/MART-1/tyrosinase two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows up to four mitotic figures in dermal melanocytes/section.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows only an interstitial loss in chr. 3p around the area of the BAP-1 gene, and no other gains or losses. This is against progression toward melanoma.  Using the DNA extracted for this procedure, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  In sum, the findings are those of an atypical Spitz tumor with BAP-1 loss, but not progression toward a BAP-1 deficient spitzoid melanoma. A narrow re-excision of this site would still be prudent, as lesions with BAP-1 loss may convert to melanoma at a higher rate than other spitzoid neoplasms.

Your submitted phosphohistone-H3 immunostain demonstrates that the mitotic index is low, but this finding is of little diagnostic comfort, as the mitotic rate in many examples of nevoid melanoma approaches zero. Immunohistochemistry for p16 was additionally completed and demonstrates mosaic positivity, and this implies that biallelic loss in CDKN2A is not apparent in this tumor. (If biallelic loss was present, it would compellingly favor the diagnosis of melanoma.) The defined findings were certainly plausible as an atypical melanocytic nevus, but I did not feel that nevoid melanoma of 0.75 mm in thickness could be excluded on histopathologic grounds. In light of this and as per your authorization, we additionally completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss, as would be expected in association with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 7q with loss of telomeric chromosome 6q (not involving the MYB gene) with no other associated gains or losses. The gain in chromosome 7q includes a spike in the vicinity of 7q34, and this finding suggests that BRAF gene fusion has occurred. As background for fully understanding the molecular result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated significant chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations or show a monoaberration, as is apparent here (the loss of telomeric 6q is trivial and is not of larger diagnostic significance, and thus the gain in 7q qualifies as a monoaberration).  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced confirmation of a diagnosis of nevoid melanoma. Rather, I believe the proliferation represents a partially transformed melanocytic nevus with underlying BRAF gene fusion. Returning to the slide after analyzing the molecular findings, there are subtle spitzoid characteristics that I did not fully appreciate in my prior evaluation. Based upon these findings coupled with the molecular result, I believe this melanocytic nevus is best categorized within the spectrum of Spitz nevus.  Gene fusion, including BRAF gene fusion, represents a not uncommon mechanism of induction of Spitz nevi and Spitz tumors. Such tumors are only minimally or partially transformed and typically hold no larger clinical potential. With that said, as this biopsy is only partial in nature, conservative complete reexcision can be considered as follow-up management. The intent of reexcision is simply to ensure complete removal and verify that persistence with additional transformation cannot ensue.

Staining for BAP-1 did not show loss of nuclear staining, as would point to a mutation in that gene (present in a specific subset of Spitz's nevi and other spitzoid lesions). However, there is nearly complete loss of p16 staining, which can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasm, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16 is located. This loss of staining can also occur by epigenetic means, and is not entirely specific for melanoma.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization.  It shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. The chromosomal copy number changes that we found include loss of chr. 1p, loss involving much of chr. 4, gain of 8q, loss of 9p, loss of 10, loss of 22. Many of these are classic aberrations seen in melanoma. The loss of chr. 9p correlates with the absence of p16 by immunohistochemistry.

The findings are more atypical than those of a Spitz's nevus. The worrisome aspects include variable cellularity at the same stratum of the dermis, the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and heterochromasia, and mitotic figures relatively deep in the lesion. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows losses involving chromosomes 9, 13 and 14, and a gain involving chr. 15. While chromosome 9 loss is common in melanoma, it can occur as an isolated finding in benign spitzoid neoplasms. In this case, it is not accompanied by other common chromosomal copy number changes seen in melanoma, but by two relatively idiosyncratic ones (loss of chrs. 13 and 14) and by an intermediate frequency one.  Following the same microdissection and DNA extraction, we also performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  Given these findings, I favor an atypical Spitz tumor with a low risk of extranodal spread, but a higher one that if the CGH profile had been negative. My colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian also viewed the CGH array data and agrees with this interpretation of it. If it has not yet been done, a narrow re-excision of this site seems prudent.

My differential diagnosis included a large desmoplastic Spitz nevus, a so-called HRAS-mutated Spitz nevus, and an 'atypical Spitz tumor'. As is discussed in the paragraphs that follow, the diagnosis of HRAS-mutated Spitz nevus has now been confirmed. Ancillary analysis was recommended and has been completed, as per your authorization. Immunohistochemistry for p16 was completed to assess (or infer) the copy number status of CDKN2A, and mosaic immunopositivity has been demonstrated; this implies that significant genomic loss in CDKN2A has not occurred. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was additionally completed to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss throughout the genome. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed isolated gain in chromosome 11p as a monoaberration with no additional chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The identification of isolated gain in chromosome 11p corresponds to mutation in HRAS and can be considered confirmatory of the above diagnosis.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH confirms the diagnosis of HRAS-mutated Spitz nevus.

IN THICKNESS",173701,172.7,"The very large size of the superficial nests, the number of mitotic figures within them, and the large bulbous mass that protrudes into the superficial subcutis are features that lie beyond those of a Spitz's nevus and make the differential diagnosis between that of an atypical Spitz tumor and a spitzoid melanoma. Some relatively deep mitotic figures are present as well. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a complex pattern of gains and losses on chr. 3p including an amplification of an area around MiTF. While the area of loss encompassed the BAP-1 gene on chr. 3p, no loss of BAP-1 was seen by immunohistochemistry, making it unlikely that a BAP-1 mutation was present. MiTF amplifications are usually found in high grade melanomas, and seldom in spitzoid lesions in children. There is a loss of chr. 6q, and a gain of chr. 7. A gain of part of chr. X is also present. The chr. 6q loss has a copy number transition around ROS1, which can point to a ROS gene fusion.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  In sum, while the hTERT promoter gene was wild type, the findings by CGH included MiTF amplification, which in addition to the other chromosomal copy number changes favors melanoma. My colleague Dr. Iwei Yei also reviewed the sections and CGH data, and agree with this interpretation. I would note that spitzoid melanomas in children have a much better prognosis than conventional ones of the same thickness in adults. The neoplasm extends to the base of the specimen.

Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. It shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi in adult patients. The aberrations include loss of the pericentromeric area of chr. 1p and loss of 1q, loss of the distal part of chr. 6q, loss of chr. 9, and loss of chr. 17. Losses of chr. 6q and 9 are common in melanoma, although usually the entire arm of chr. 6q is lost. Gains of 1p are common in melanoma rather than losses of it. However, taking into account the atypical histopathologic features and these aberrations, I favor the diagnosis above.

This unusual tumor includes both conventional melanocytic nevus and a secondary component resembling a deep penetrating nevus, and the latter component exhibits associated neurotropism and adnexotropism. Your immunoperoxidase stains demonstrate that expression of p16 is generally preserved and that the Ki-67 cell proliferation index is low, and both of these labeling results are as would be expected with a melanocytic nevus, or at least do not provide clear support to interpretation as melanoma. Immunostaining for beta catenin was included in our evaluation and is negative. Some but not all examples of deep penetrating nevus exhibit nuclear positivity with beta catenin immunohistochemistry, as activating mutations in beta catenin are common to their pathogenesis.  In terms of potential considerations in the differential diagnosis, I found myself unable to render a diagnosis of neurotropic melanoma (arising in conjunction with a melanocytic nevus) on histopathologic grounds, but obviously the finding of marked neurotropism is extreme and unusual. To clarify the diagnosis, we additionally completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss, as per your authorization. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in chromosome 1p, focal loss in telomeric chromosome 2q, and gain in telomeric chromosome 7q, including the region where BRAF is encoded. This unusual molecular result with multiple small aberrations does not provide support to interpretation as frank melanoma but also indicates that this proliferation does not represent any form of conventional melanocytic nevus. In short, these combined histopathologic and molecular results suggest a partially transformed tumor; the findings we have defined are roughly equivalent to what is often termed 'atypical Spitz tumor'. My colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh, also reviewed the molecular results for this case and is in agreement that the defined findings do not support interpretation as melanoma.  The neurotropic component of this unusual tumor extends focally to the inked specimen margin. Reexcision to obtain a free margin is recommended.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology. J Cutan Pathol. 2011; 38:323-5.","Sections show a proliferation of melanocytes with two separate cellular components (a biphasic pattern). There are both small conventional melanocytes in nests and syncytia as well as large fusiform and ovoid melanocytes with finely pigmented cytoplasm. The latter cells are arrayed in coalescing nests, cords, fascicles, and syncytia throughout the upper and lower reticular dermis and also in the adventitial dermis without clear circumscription. In the upper dermis, some fusiform melanocytes are enlarged. A robust deep lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with admixed melanophages is also noted -- and this includes some lymphoid follicles.

While the peripheral component is mostly nested, featuring bridging and fibroplasia, there is more pagetoid scatter in the Mart-1 immunostains than could be appreciated in the hematoxylin eosin-stained sections. Also, as you note there is compression of the elastic fiber network, and although the dermal melanocytes are relatively small they have slightly more cytoplasm than in most dysplastic nevi. Given the difficulties of this case, I obtained comparative genomic hybridization to see if chromosomal copy number changes as found in melanoma were present or not. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This showed a gain involving the terminal portion of chr. 2q, and one involving chr. 6p. While the number of chromosomal copy number changes is limited, gain of chr. 6p is highly characteristic of melanoma and in the context of the microscopic findings is, in my opinion, sufficient for a diagnosis of melanoma. I included the larger of the dermal cells in the thickness, but not the small, round melanocytes loosely arranged at the base of the papillary dermis (which may be those of a pre-existent nevus).

The latter raises the possibility of additional transformation, vs. the presence of a combined deep penetrating nevic component. This is not supported by a beta catenin immunostain, which shows only cytoplasmic membranous staining, and not nuclear staining, as we have seen in a proportion of deep penetrating nevi (manuscript in press, Nature Genetics). There is nearly complete loss of p16 staining, which can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasm, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16 is located. This loss of staining can also occur by epigenetic means, and is not entirely specific for melanoma.  A phosphohistone H3/MART-1/tyrosinase two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows at least one deep mitotic figure and several superficial melanocytes with positive nuclei.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a loss involving chr. 9, but not in a pattern that would correlate with homozygous loss of CDKN2A, which encodes p16. There are near-threshold gains and losses around the centromere of chr. 10. These do not have breakpoints around known melanoma-associated genes. Dr. Boris Bastian also viewed the chr. 10 results, and would not make a diagnosis of melanoma based on them.  Following the same microdissection and DNA extraction for CGH, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  Given these findings, an atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. The value of the latter is questionable, especially given the results of the multi-center trial just reported in N. Engl. J. Med. 2017 Jun 8;376(23):2211-2222.

A phosphohistone H3/MART-1/tyrosinase two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows several positive nuclei in the upper or mid-part of the lesion.

Such areas can in some cases indicate melanoma.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. Comparative genomic hybridization shows no significant chromosomal copy number changes. An idiosyncratic finding- a loss of a small pericentromeric area in chr. 9q was present. This area does not contain any tumor suppressor genes known to play a role in melanomagenesis. About 95% of conventional melanomas show significant losses or gains with this technique.  Using the DNA extracted for CGH, we also performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  An atypical Spitz tumor seems to be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.

This shows loss of chr. 10, which is a highly characteristic chromosomal copy number change seen in melanoma, with gains in both chr. 11p and 11q (the gain in chr. 11p is of higher amplitude). The former hints at an h-ras mutation. While h-ras mutated Spitz's nevi have isolated chr. 11p gains, and behave benignly, the presence of additional changes in this case means that its presence does not favor benignity. There is also a loss involving chr. 13q.  My colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh also viewed the comparative genomic hybridization results, and the sections and agreed with this diagnosis. One of the deep penetrating nevus-like melanomas in our study had an h-ras mutation.

Some strikingly large and irregularly shaped nuclei are present in these cells. The sizes of the nests are larger than in most deep penetrating nevi.

A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product in either population. A PRAME immunostain is negative.

To further evaluate this second population, p16 and BAP-1 immunohistochemical stains were performed. The BAP-1 stain demonstrated retention of this nuclear protein, excluding the possibility of a BAP-1 inactivated melanocytoma. The p16 stain was also strongly retained in both populations, confirming that biallelic loss of CDKN2A has not occurred. We additionally performed staining for cilia, which has been shown to be lost in conventional melanoma and retained in nevi. This stain also demonstrated a reassuring pattern of cilia retention in both populations (ref). Overall, the histopathologic pattern seen in this lesion is not classic for any known underlying mechanisms, but has some features of a combined desmoplastic nevus with both conventional and deep penetrating nevus components. The lesion appears focally transected at the periphery and clear at the deep edge. As this lesion is unconventional, reexcision of this site to define a free margin and prevent further persistence is recommended as follow-up management. Dr. McCalmont has also reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis.  References: Lang UE, Love NR, Cheung C, McCalmont TH, Kim J.

With that having been noted, please additionally note that I do not believe this tumor is of conventional lineage, meaning that I do not believe that an underlying BRAF or NRAS mutation served as the molecular starting point. Rather, to my eye the histopathologic pattern suggests a small cell Spitz nevus induced by kinase gene fusion. More narrowly, I suspect a Spitz nevus induced by MYO5A/NTRK3 gene fusion. As my diagnosis implies, I believe there is only one population of melanocytes in these sections. There are some large nests that probably correlate with the recent enlargement observed clinically, and there is also stromal hyalinization as an apparent indicator of longevity. There is no evidence of malignancy, and there is also no indication of atypicality, at least not in the conventional sense of that term.  Thank you for providing unstained slides.

I evaluated immunohistochemistry for BRAF V600E and RAS Q61R and the tumor does not harbor these mutations, arguing against melanoma of the low-CSD pathway. Given these findings and the absence of a junctional component, the initial differential diagnosis included clear cell sarcoma, the relatively new entity cutaneous melanocytic tumor with CRTC1::TRIM11 translocation (CTMCT), and melanoma with other initiating oncogenes, including Spitz melanoma. Focal staining for HMB45 as seen in this case has been reported in a significant number of CTMCT.  Breakapart fluorescence in situ hybridization for EWSR1 rearrangement was negative. Follow-up testing for TRIM11 rearrangement was positive, and thus this represents a CTMCT. The neoplasm extends to the margins, and additional excision is indicated. The biologic behavior of this recently defined entity is not well understood, but in the ~50 cases reported in the literature, there was a relatively low rate of distant metastasis and the current understanding at the time is that this is a low-grade malignant tumor with a better prognosis than clear cell sarcoma or melanoma.

Please refer to reports 15-16907 and 15-27070 for additional information. My addendum commentary regarding this specimen, from 2007, follows below. ADDENDUM, September 14, 2007: After my original interpretation of this case as a combined melanocytic nevus, I received 3 additional slides of this tissue from Dr. Sundram. The new slides highlight occasional dermal melanocytes in mitosis. I also received HMB-45 and Ki-67 stains completed at Stanford Pathology. The HMB-45 stain is completely non-reactive, while the Ki-67 stain shows scattered positively-labeled nuclei, with a low overall labeling rate. I interpret the Ki-67 immunostaining results as supportive of a benign diagnosis and I continue to favor a diagnosis of combined melanocytic nevus (with the commingling of both conventional melanocytic nevus and epithelioid Spitz's nevus).  Dr. Philip LeBoit reviewed this case independently (including review of the 3 additional slides and the immunoperoxidase stains) and came to an identical diagnosis. We do not believe this lesion should be considered to represent melanoma.","Sections show a domed and partially polypoid proliferation of melanocytes with a biphasic pattern. One population of melanocytes consists of relatively small cells with scant or amphophilic cytoplasm, arrayed as dermal nests, cords, and syncytia. A small number of these melanocytes have more abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and are multinucleate. The second population consists of large epithelioid melanocytes with enlarged nuclei and ample eosinophilic cytoplasm, arrayed singly and in small clusters, partially commingling with the first population. There is permeative lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, mostly associated with the large epithelioid melanocytes. Subsequently, in three additional slides received, occasional dermal melanocytes in mitosis are evident.",F,55.0,,,,,

ADDENDUM, July 17, 2011: The following note has been modified from that in the original report, a copy of which is on file as .pdfs in our computer system:  This report was re-issued after the medical record number was added to the case record.","There is a broad, asymmetric and poorly circumscribed atypical melanocytic neoplasm characterized by large nests and sheets of melanocytes along an atrophic epidermis and throughout the papillary and reticular dermis. In some areas, there are small nests and individual melanocytes in the spinous and granular layers of the epidermis. There is focal fibrosis with melanophages. The melanocytes vary greatly in size from small to large with nuclear pleomorphism and many atypical mitoses.  Two of the sections have ulceration without crust and melanocytes throughout the dermis.",M,65.0,,0.9,,,

A p16 stain labels only rare cells (less than 5%). My initial assessment of this lesion was that it is not a conventional Spitz's nevus, but a lesion with low metastatic potential (referred to as atypical Spitz tumor in some studies). However, comparative genomic hybridization shows a loss of chromosome 9, and a gain involving most of chromosome 7. The chromosome 9 loss corroborates the near-total absence of staining for p16, as the gene is located on 9p. Gains involving chromosome 7 and losses involving chromosome 9 are common aberrations in melanoma.  Hence, I believe an outright diagnosis of melanoma is more apt.  The lesion appears to have been narrowly excised.","Sections show a moderately narrow, relatively symmetrical proliferation of large oval melanocytes involving the superficial dermis.

The more striking cytologic atypia seen in the lesions that I term spitzoid melanoma of childhood is not evident. Similar lesions to this one have been reported under a variety of names, including atypical Spitz tumor. They tend to involve local (and sentinel) lymph nodes at a relatively high rate, but distant metastasis is unlikely. Given the sharp circumscription of the lesion, one could consider a re-excision of this site, but I have not seen lesions of this type recur when excised by even a few millimeters. With regard to sentinel lymph node biopsy, there is little prognostic information as there is such a disparity between a percent of patients with nodal involvement and distant metastases. Comparative genomic hybridization does not show clear-cut evidence of chromosomal gains or losses. Because deflections were present in the plotted CGH data, we consulted with our former colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian (now chairman of Pathology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Medical Center, New York) who agrees that no definite aberrations are present. The lack of aberrations does not exclude the possibility of melanoma, but makes it less likely (aberrations, especially multiple ones in loci characteristic of conventional melanomas would have resulted in an outright diagnosis of melanoma in this case). If one is looking for a more specific name for a lesion like this one, atypical Spitz tumor may be apt.  Please note that a margin of about a millimeter or so is present between the neoplasm and the peripheral margin. Lesions of this type are usually well circumscribed, and do not recur even with narrow excision margins, if the excision margins are histopathologically proven. Hence, I believe that this site could be treated with a reexcision of only a few more millimeters.","There is a proliferation of melanocytes with a domed surface and a wedge-shaped base. The overlying epidermis is alternatively thinned and irregularly thickened. There are large, confluent nests of cells with relatively monomorphous oval vesicular nuclei and abundant pale amphophilic cytoplasm.

Given these findings, I was concerned that this is a spitzoid melanoma and not Spitz's nevus. Comparative genomic hybridization shows no loss or gain of chromosomal material. This favors a benign interpretation, or a low grade neoplasm with limited metastatic potential (what some call atypical Spitz tumors). About 95% of conventional melanomas show detectable losses or gains with this technique. However, given the limited nuclear atypia and negative comparative genomic hybridization results, I cannot make a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma. A narrow re-excision of this site is advisable.","There is a dome-surfaced, focally ulcerated proliferation of moderately enlarged oval melanocytes with pale cytoplasm and monomorphous vesicular nuclei that have small nucleoli.

The documentation of multiple chromosomal anomalies is strongly supportive of the above diagnosis of melanoma.

I agree that this lesion has several features that push the limits for the diagnosis of Spitz's nevus, including a relatively thin epidermis, above-average nuclear pleomorphism and the presence of several deep mitotic figures. There are many dermatopathologists who would classify this as a so-called atypical Spitz tumor, a diagnostic term that is, unfortunately, used in different ways by different observers. However, it captures the sense that the lesion does not conform to the standard features of a Spitz's nevus, but does not have sufficiently atypical findings for an outright diagnosis of melanoma. Comparative genomic hybridization with an array based method shows an isolated gain involving the terminal end of 7q. This aberration, when seen without other gains or losses usually occurs in benign lesions (similar to gains of 11p). Hence, an unusual Spitz's nevus is the most likely finding. A narrow re-excision would still be appropriate.","There is a dome-surfaced proliferation of large oval melanocytes involving the junctional zone, a thickened papillary dermis and the upper portion of the reticular dermis centered around a folliculosebaceous unit. The lesion is relatively symmetrical, and well circumscribed. Only a few junctional nests are present, with slightly increased numbers of single melanocytes, mostly over the apex of the lesion. The superficial dermal portion of the proliferation consists of cells with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei, some of which have large and/or multiple nucleoli. Somewhat smaller cells are seen in smaller aggregations toward the base of the lesion. Several deep mitotic figures are evident, including one within a high power microscopic field of the deep edge of the lesion (a so-called marginal mitosis).",M,7.0,,,,,

After extraction of tumoral DNA, aCGH assessment demonstrated gain in chromosome 7q and no other genomic aberrations. Chromosome 7q gain as a monoaberration does not presently have defined significance. We have observed it in melanocytic tumors interpreted ambiguously. A monoaberration in chromosome 7q is not sufficient to warrant interpretation as childhood-type spitzoid melanoma. In summary, based upon the combination of conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH results, I continue to favor a hypercellular Spitz nevus as most likely.

Additionally, the striking confluence of junctional nests is of concern.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows no chromosomal gains or losses.

It is very well circumscribed, and lesions of this type seldom recur in the scar from the previous biopsy. Also, it is very common for spitzoid lesions of all types (including benign Spitz nevi) to have small clusters of spitzoid melanocytes in a sentinel lymph node.

It also contains a somewhat syncytial arrangement of dermal melanocytes. It did not thus display features of a conventional Spitz's nevus by any means. As the differential diagnosis included spitzoid melanoma, such lesions often prompt analysis by comparative genomic hybridization, a molecular technique that uses lesional tissue from the paraffin block. It is based on the presence of chromosomal gains and losses in about 95% of melanomas, but with the exception of a gain of 11p, a lack of them in Spitz's nevi. A reference on this technique and its applicability to this differential diagnosis is listed below. This testing has now been completed, and shows multiple chromosomal aberrations. There is a complete loss of chromosome 9, a finding which on its own may not be of particular significance, but in combination with the other aberrations noted, supports a diagnosis of melanoma. There is a loss of chromosome 1p, as well as losses of part of chromosome 17 and 19p as well. These findings, along with the atypical histologic features noted, confirm the diagnosis of melanoma. In terms of staging, pertinent prognostic features summarized below. I have also shared this case with my colleague, Dr. Philip LeBoit, who agrees with this diagnosis.

Similar melanocytes are present within the overlying epidermis, which is slightly hyperplastic, mainly in single array, within the lower epidermis.

The constituent cells label with S100, and variably with HMB45 and MART-1, with no significant staining with CD68 or high molecular weight cytokeratin.

The lineage of the neoplastic cells was confirmed in a Melan-A immunostain, as the tumor displays only scant pigment. With regard to the staging of subungual melanoma, Clark's levels are not reported, as the typical arrangement of papillary and reticular dermis is not present in the nail unit per se. The exception is for Clark's level V, which is assigned when periosteal involvement is present. That finding cannot be assessed in the current sections. There is no evidence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion in these sections. However, given the potentially large size of the area of involvement indicated in the clinical photographs we received previously, definitive assessment of all prognostic features should be deferred to the complete reexcision specimen.","Sections show distorted nail bed epithelium, containing a proliferation of atypical melanocytes arranged in an irregular pattern within the epidermis, and with similar cells in sheets in the dermis. Only scant melanin pigment is present. In the portion of epithelium, there is suprabasal scatter of melanocytes, and they may also be present in the overlying stratum corneum.

These include a loss involving chromosome 6p, a partial loss of 6q, an amplification (high level copy number gain) of 7q, a loss of 9p and a loss of 9qter. Losses involving 6q and 9p are particularly common in melanoma. While isolated gains involving chromosome 7q can be seen in Spitz's nevus, gene amplifications (gains of not just an extra copy, but many extra copies) are not. Dr. Boris Bastian also reviewed the comparative genomic hybridization data and agrees with this interpretation of it.  The lesion is broadly transected, and may be considerably thicker than the 3.2 mm that I measured on the slide. Given the comparative genomic hybridization results and morphology, I believe that this lesion should be classified as a spitzoid melanoma of childhood, i.e., an emerging class of lesions that usually lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. Most lesions of this type are well circumscribed and relatively narrow re-excision margins are adequate for local control. The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy seems even less than in adult melanoma, as the predictive value of nodal involvement for distant disease is less, and there is little evidence that completion lymphadenectomy has an effect on survival.","Sections show a papillated segment of skin with a predominantly dermal proliferation of melanocytes, most of which have abundant, pale cytoplasm and large, oval vesicular nuclei. The overlying epidermis is focally hyperplastic. A few junctional nests are present. The dermal aggregations are variably confluent.

Thank you for arranging for p16 immunostaining to be completed in your laboratory; relatively avid expression of p16 was documented. We also received a clinical request for us to complete array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in chromosome 9 with no other chromosomal gains or losses. Loss in chromosome 9 represents a relatively common aberration in childhood spitzoid melanoma, but we do not consider it sufficient to be fully decisive from a diagnostic standpoint (most melanomas have multiple genomic aberrations). In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH raises childhood-type spitzoid melanoma as a possibility, but these molecular findings are not decisively diagnostic. This atypical melanocytic proliferation is 2.1 mm in thickness and involves the deep edge of the current specimen. Complete reexcision of this site is warranted in follow-up. My personal opinion is that nodal assessment is not beneficial in this context, as any results found do not correlate with prognosis, in contrast to experience with adult melanoma.","Sections show a domed compound proliferation of enlarged melanocytes, and the epidermis above these cells is thinned. There are very large nests and fascicles of melanocytes just below the junction, and a few central nests are noted above this. In dermis below this, partially-maturing nests, fascicles, and cords of similar melanocytes can be seen, and a number of dermal melanocytes in mitosis can be identified.",,8.0,,,,,

Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively high proliferation rate in deep dermal melanocytes, with about 10% of nuclei positive in some aggregations). A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows scattered mitotic figures in both superficial and deep melanocytes. The proliferation rate and lack of maturation with descent are worrisome, raising the possibility of a spitzoid melanoma. Comparative genomic hybridization shows gains involving the distal portion of chromosome 7q and 11p. These two aberrations are found in a minority of Spitz's nevi, usually in isolation, but occasionally together. The deeply infiltrative pattern is one associated with 11p gain; we are in the process of analyzing the findings in Spitz's nevi with 7q gain, and those with both aberrations. Given this result, I would follow the site clinically.","There is a broad-based, roughly wedge-shaped pan-dermal and superficial subcutaneous proliferation of large oval and fusiform melanocytes.

However, the patient recently noted a more rapid rate of growth. My initial differential diagnosis included an unusual nevus with Spitzoid features and melanoma. To further evaluate for this differential diagnosis, I performed comparative genomic hybridization on this specimen. This is a molecular technique that evaluates for the presence of chromosomal gains or losses. It is based on the presence of chromosomal gains and losses in about 95% of melanomas, but with the exception of a gain of 11p, a lack of them in Spitz's nevi.  The comparative genomic hybridization has now been completed and it shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi.  In particular there is a loss of chromosome 6q, a gain of chromosome 7q, both a loss and a gain of chromosome 12p and a gain of chromosome 18q. The presence of multiple gains and losses supports the diagnosis of melanoma.  With regard to staging, the melanoma is between 2-4 millimeters in thickness and is not ulcerated. Therefore it should be classified as pT3a per the 2009 revision of the AJCC staging system for melanoma.  My colleague, Dr. Timothy McCalmont, also reviewed these sections and agrees with this diagnosis and assessment.","Sections show a dome-shaped segment of acral skin in which there is a compound proliferation of melanocytes, some of which are large and epithelioid, and the junctional component of which is arrayed with the lowermost sections of an epithelium that is slightly acanthotic and hyperkeratotic.

Selected immunostains were included in our analysis. Immunostaining for p16, which represents the gene product of the CDKN2A gene, demonstrates a significant loss of reactivity, as is common in association with melanoma. Phosphohistone-H3 immunostaining (in combination with Melan-A) confirms that relatively florid pagetoid scatter of melanocytes is present, and the phosphohistone-H3 component of the combined immunostain fails to demonstrate any dermal melanocytes in mitosis. With respect to staging, this non-ulcerated melanoma does not have melanocytes in mitosis in its invasive component, as was corroborated by phosphohistone-H3 immunostaining. Therefore, it represents a melanoma of stage pT1a (2009 AJCC Guidelines). Further excision is warranted to ensure that local control has been established.","Sections show melanocytes arrayed irregularly and in pagetoid fashion in the epidermis and as partially maturing nests, cords, and fascicles in the dermis.

Thus, the differential diagnosis was between a spitzoid melanoma and an unusual Spitz's nevus. To further evaluate for this differential diagnosis, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on this tissue. The CGH data shows a small abnormality on the proximal portion of chromosome 5p, but it is very subtle and of uncertain significance. Therefore, our interpretation of the CGH data is that it does not show any meaningful chromosomal gains or losses.  Despite the normal CGH, given that numerous mitotic figures are present among lesional melanocytes, that many of the melanocytes have large, hyperchromatic nuclei, and the melanocytes are arranged as sheets, we are still quite concerned that the findings in this biopsy represent those of a spitzoid melanoma. If a melanoma has chromosomal aberrations that are copy number neutral, CGH will not show any aberrations, which could explain the normal CGH data in this case. If this lesion does represent a melanoma, it is 8.5 millimeters in thickness. However, as you know, spitzoid melanomas in children tend to behave in a less aggressive fashion compared with conventional melanomas of equivalent thickness. Therefore, the thickness measurement mentioned above should be interpreted in this context.  The residual melanoma present in this specimen is located at least 6 millimeters from all of the inked margins.  My colleagues, Drs. Timothy McCalmont, Philip LeBoit and Boris Bastian have seen these sections and agree with this assessment.","Sections show a large segment of skin in which there is a superficial scar. In addition, there is an intradermal proliferation of large melanocytes arranged as nodular aggregations of varying sizes. Many of the lesional melanocytes contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and some have eccentrically located nuclei. In addition, many of the lesional melanocytes contain prominent nucleoli. The size of the melanocytes generally does not diminish with descent into the dermis. Lesional melanocytes aggregate around nerves in the deep aspect of the specimen. Mitotic figures are present within the proliferation.",,13.0,,,,,

The latter are irregular in shape, but not strikingly atypical. Mitotic figures are very few. The enclosed immunoperoxidase-stained sections demonstrate that the proliferation is S100 and Melan-A positive.",,8.0,,,,,

On balance, I favor the former possibility as most likely, but I do not believe that an utterly definitive diagnosis is possible based solely on histopathologic parameters. Given the extremely unusual configuration of this tumor, molecular analysis has been recommended.  We are just in receipt of the tissue block and will proceed with array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies. A diagnostic delay of approximately 3 weeks will ensue while molecular testing is completed.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. These include a gain of chr. 5p, loss of 5q, loss of 6qter, loss of 9, loss of a pericentromeric area of 12, loss of 17 and losses and gains in a complex pattern in chr. 22. This melanoma has myxoid stroma, a finding of histopathologic interest, but not relevant to clinical behavior. A superficial dermal margin is involved.","Sections show a compound proliferation of melanocytes that is slightly asymmetrical. Along the junction, single melanocytes and large fascicles of finely pigmented melanocytes are noted, and these fascicles are noteworthy for the presence of ample myxoid change. In the dermis below this, partially maturing nests, cords, and syncytia of similar melanocytes are noted. In some areas in the dermis, the melanocytes become epithelioid or spindled in configuration, and a flanking infiltrate of lymphocytes and melanophages is noted. Scattered melanophages are present concurrently (Microscopic description by Dr. Timothy McCalmont).",,48.0,,1.2,,,

Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows an interstitial loss flanking the BAP-1 gene on chr. 3p, and what appears to be a bi-allelic loss involving CDKN2A on chr. 9p. The latter is indicative of melanoma. A BAP-1 immunostain shows no loss of nuclear positivity. Given the results of comparative genomic hybridization, this could indicate the loss of one allele, and a mutation of the other allele of BAP-1 that produces a protein that is mutated, but still can bind the antibody. Staining for p16 shows a very low positivity rate, in keeping with the loss of CDKN2A by CGH.  The findings contrast with those seen in proliferative nodules, in which there are gains or losses of whole chromosomes.  ADDENDUM, October 14, 2015: I re-evaluated the comparative genomic hybridization array graph, and the interstitial deletion noted above is in chr. 4p, not 3p. This does not affect the diagnosis, given the bi-allelic loss in 9p around CDKN2A, but does explain why there was no loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry.","Sections show a large, oval mass of large, oval melanocytes, some with a plasmacytoid appearance, with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, pleomorphic vesicular nuclei with coarse chromatin.

Our analysis (as delineated in the paragraphs that follow) indicates that metastatic melanoma can be considered excluded, although that phenomenon was entertained as a potential consideration in the differential diagnosis. Rather than melanoma, I favor interpretation as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). With respect to immunoperoxidase staining results, EMA shows considerable positivity, as can be seen in the context of peripheral nerve sheath tumors. There is a paucity of p16 expression, which was taken as being indicative of CDKN2A genomic loss (this has been borne out by molecular analysis, as is discussed in the next paragraph). INI-1 and H3K27me3 immunostains both show retained nuclear expression (loss of either can be seen in some examples of MPNST). In short, the immunohistochemical profile is not decisively diagnostic.  Simultaneously, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss. Direct genetic comparison with the papular melanocytic tumor removed from this patient in 2012 was not possible, as it was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) rather than by aCGH. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosomes 5p, 6, 7, 8, telomeric 9q, 13q, 16, 19, 20, and 21q. There is also subthreshold gain in chromosomes 11 and 12. Additionally, genomic loss was identified in chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5q, 9p (correlating with the p16 staining result), 10p, centromeric 10q, 14q, and 18. Because of the tremendous number of gains and losses, it is possible that the software had trouble localizing the log0 baseline; while this could shift the magnitude of some of the observed aberrations, it would not affect the number of aberrations observed. Please note that a number of the defined genomic aberrations are uncommon in association with melanoma. Based upon comparison with genomic results we have observed in a data set of >2000 analyzed tumors, the genomic profile that we have defined is not compatible with a diagnosis of melanoma. Dr. Boris Bastian reviewed the molecular data and agrees with that conclusion.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with immunohistochemistry and aCGH indicate that this malignancy does not represent melanoma or metastatic melanoma; . Given the fact that the tumor cells avidly express SOX-10 and S100 protein, MPNST becomes the foremost alternative in the differential diagnosis, although the immunophenotype of this tumor, using newer reagents, is not necessarily prototypical of MPNST.  Slide D14-14251C has additionally been reviewed and demonstrates a papular melanocytic nevus; it is unrelated to the changes observed in the 2016 specimen. The slides from case DL12-57813 have also been re-reviewed; I can simply state that the small melanocytic proliferation seen in the 2012 specimen has a different immunophenotype from that defined in association with the 2016 specimen and that the 2012 findings are not obviously supportive of a diagnosis of melanoma on histopathologic grounds. Please refer to my prior report from 2012 for additional information.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology. J Cutan Pathol. 2011; 38:323-5.  I recognize that this report is tremendously complex. I would be happy to discuss it with any member of the clinical team.","Sections from D16-50876 show sheets, nests, and fascicles of enlarged cells expressing S100 protein and SOX-10 but not Melan-A in a complex background that is extensively myxoid and fibrous but that also includes circumscribed lymphoid tissue. Cells in mitosis, small areas of necrosis, and strikingly dilated vascular channels are noted. There are some peripheral areas that include smaller fusiform cells in a myxoid and collagenous background. Slides from D14-14251C demonstrate a small compound proliferation of melanocytes with a lentiginous intraepidermal component and with a thin lymphohistiocytic infiltrate accompanying maturing pigmented dermal melanocytes.

IN THICKNESS",273588,172.5,"Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. The hybridization shows gain of chr. 6p, and a loss involving an area on chr. 6q with the ARID1B gene near its breakpoint. Gain of 6p and loss of 6q are commonly found together in melanoma, and the finding of a breakpoint at a gene important in melanomagenesis further supports that diagnosis. The biopsy and re-excision from this lesion correlate for an approximate thickness of 6 mm. A beta-catenin immunostain labels not only the cytoplasm of the lesional melanocytes but also their nuclei. This supports the assessment of a deep penetrating nevic lineage, per a recent study from our group. This lineage includes deep penetrating nevus, indeterminate lesions, and deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma.  In the re-excision, the neoplasm was a fraction of a mm. from the deep margin near the center of the specimen, and a further excision (still deeper, but not necessary wider) seems warranted.  The comparative genomic hybridization data was also reviewed by my colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian who agrees with this interpretation of it.

Although there are some features similar to those seen in a Spitz's nevus, and in fact, we considered an unusual Spitz's nevus as an alternative diagnosis, this proliferation is markedly asymmetrical.  In addition, mitotic figures are readily evident within the dermal component.  I have also shared this case with my colleague, Dr. Philip LeBoit, who agrees that melanoma is a more appropriate diagnosis based on these findings. In terms of staging, this is a nonulcerated primary melanoma of Clark's anatomic level at least IV. There is no evidence of vascular invasion, neurotropism, or regression. Definitive assessment of thickness as well as other prognostic factors should also be deferred to the complete excision specimen.","Sections show a compound proliferation of large spindled and epithelioid melanocytes, the junctional component of which is arrayed with the lowermost sections of an epithelium that is slightly acanthotic and hyperkeratotic. The junctional component is asymmetrical, and extends far lateral to the dermal component at one edge.  Rare melanocytes are positioned above the basal layer, and there is focal crust and serum.  The dermal component is also asymmetrical.  It consists of large and small clusters and syncytia of similar melanocytes, with slight dispersion of the base, but with little diminishment in size with the dermal descent.  Many mitotic figures are identifiable within the dermal component, in the superficial and mid dermal components mainly. Minimal solar elastosis is evident.",,46.0,,2.3,,,
