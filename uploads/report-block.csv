This is a difficult case in which expert dermatopathologists could have differences of opinions. For me, findings against a Spitz's nevus include a thinned rather than thickened epidermis, the presence of epithelial collarettes, and at least in the bulbous portion of the lesion that extends to the deep reticular dermis, very little maturation. The cells are not classic Spitz cells, lacking sufficient amounts of cytoplasm, and their cytoplasm is pale and vacuolated. This having been said, my instinct is that this is not a conventional melanoma, either. It has the silhouette more typically seen in spitzoid melanomas in children and adolescent patients. This patient is obviously older than that age group, but the lesion may be similar. Among such lesions, sentinel lymph nodes are often involved, but distant metastases are rare. Hence, I would be reluctant to tell this patient that their prognosis is that of a 2.3 mm, level IV melanoma. If you or the treating clinician would like us to, we can perform additional testing (analysis for a b-raf mutation, which would not be present in a Spitz's nevus or in a spitzoid melanoma of childhood type, and either fluorescence in situ hybridization or comparative genomic hybridization). I would be happy to discuss these options with you.","There is a well circumscribed, slightly asymmetric compound proliferation of melanocytes that abuts a focally thinned epidermis, and is partially encompassed by epithelial collarettes.

I evaluated immunohistochemistry for BRAF V600E and RAS Q61R and the tumor does not harbor these mutations, arguing against melanoma of the low-CSD pathway. Given these findings and the absence of a junctional component, the initial differential diagnosis included clear cell sarcoma, the relatively new entity cutaneous melanocytic tumor with CRTC1::TRIM11 translocation (CTMCT), and melanoma with other initiating oncogenes, including Spitz melanoma. Focal staining for HMB45 as seen in this case has been reported in a significant number of CTMCT.  Breakapart fluorescence in situ hybridization for EWSR1 rearrangement was negative. Follow-up testing for TRIM11 rearrangement was positive, and thus this represents a CTMCT. The neoplasm extends to the margins, and additional excision is indicated. The biologic behavior of this recently defined entity is not well understood, but in the ~50 cases reported in the literature, there was a relatively low rate of distant metastasis and the current understanding at the time is that this is a low-grade malignant tumor with a better prognosis than clear cell sarcoma or melanoma.

IN THICKNESS","ADDENDUM, April 29, 2011: The following note has been modified from that in the original report, a copy of which is on file as .pdfs in our computer system: The neoplasm extends to the edges of some of the sections, but whether these are true margins or not cannot be determined. There is a significant intraepithelial component, which led to my original supposition that this was a primary melanoma.  Given the findings on re-examination of a previous case in our files, 00-33973, we performed comparative genomic hybridization on both specimens. This specimen showed many genomic aberrations, including some commonly found in melanoma. These included a gain involving 1q, gains and losses in small areas on 5p, a loss on 5q, a gain of 6p and a loss of 6q, a loss of 8p and a gain of 8q, a gain near the end of 10q, a loss of 11q and a gain of 18p with a loss involving 18q. The quality of this hybridization was excellent, while the 2000 hybridization was not as good. However, there are clear aberrations in the 2000 hybridization shared by this one, including those involving 6p and 6q, and 8q. Also, there are clear inflections in the array of the 2000 case at most of the other sites that have aberrations in the current material.

The asymmetry of the lesion and presence of many cells with abundant, pale cytoplasm and dusty appearing melanin is against a Spitz's nevus and favors one of the other two categories. A phosphohistone H3/MART-1/tyrosinase two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows several positive nuclei in the upper or mid-part of the lesion.  While only a small minority of the melanocytes are p16 positive, I did not find extensive areas completely lacking p16 positive cells, as can be seen with bi-allelic loss of CDKN2A. Such areas can in some cases indicate melanoma.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. Comparative genomic hybridization shows no significant chromosomal copy number changes. An idiosyncratic finding- a loss of a small pericentromeric area in chr. 9q was present. This area does not contain any tumor suppressor genes known to play a role in melanomagenesis. About 95% of conventional melanomas show significant losses or gains with this technique.  Using the DNA extracted for CGH, we also performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  An atypical Spitz tumor seems to be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. As the the base of the specimen is involved, conservative re-excision of this site is warranted.   Reference:  Lee S, Barnhill RL, Dummer R, Dalton J, Wu J, Pappo A, Bahrami A.

Based solely upon conventional microscopical parameters, an unequivocal diagnosis is not possible. This is the type of challenging case for which comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) can be of value, and we proceeded with CGH analysis, as per your request. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed small segmental areas of gain and loss in chromosome 11q but other significant chromosomal gains or losses are lacking. Interestingly, these areas of anomalous genomic copy number do not involve the location of the CCND1 (cyclin-D1) gene, as might be seen in association with melanoma. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has yielded an ambiguous result. We have not identified microscopic findings or molecular aberrations that are conclusively diagnostic of childhood-type melanoma. Summing all of the available information, I favor an unconventional Spitz nevus as the best overall classification for this case. Complete reexcision of this site will be necessary in follow-up, but no other surgical intervention is indicated once local clearance has been achieved.

There are clusters of similar melanocytes in the underlying dermis.  Due to these unusual features, I sought to further evaluate this specimen via immunoperoxidase staining. Staining for BAP-1 did not show loss of nuclear staining, as would point to a mutation in that gene (present in a specific subset of Spitz's nevi and other spitzoid lesions). By contrast, there was loss of p16 staining among a subset of the junctional and dermal melanocytes, which can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasms, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16 is located.  Given the features on the routinely stained hematoxylin and eosin section, in concert with the partial loss of p16, a definitive diagnosis could not be reached based on these data. Therefore, after receiving authorization to proceed with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) testing, following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed CGH to further evaluate this proliferation.  The testing revealed gains of chromosome 7q and 10p. Otherwise, no significant abnormalities were detected. Interestingly, there were no abnormalities of chromosome 9p and thus the loss of p16 staining probably is not significant. The chromosomal abnormalities detected by the CGH study can be seen in atypical Spitz tumors, which is the category into which I would classify this lesion. The CGH results do not support the diagnosis of melanoma, since, in melanoma, there are usually many chromosomal abnormalities detected. Given that this atypical Spitz tumor has been narrow excised, I think that the site could be clinically monitored or a narrow re-excision could be performed. Both Drs. Boris Bastian and Philip LeBoit have reviewed this case and agree with this assessment.","Sections show a segment of acral skin with a compound melanocytic proliferation.  There are large polygonal, ovoid, and spindled melanocytes in nests separated by clefts from the overlying hyperplastic epidermis, and similar cells are present in collections in the dermis.  Within the epidermis, some of the melanocytes are within the spinous layer. In the dermis, some of the melanocytes contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, but the size of the melanocytes appears to diminish with descent. The melanocytes extend into the reticular dermis.",M,37.0,,,,,,1446353.0

It is unclear from the history if the ulceration is spontaneous, or due to treatment or trauma. Given the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and the sheet-like growth pattern, I proposed that molecular testing would be advantageous to see if chromosomal copy number changes, as seen in melanoma are present here. I had also proposed hTERT promoter mutation analysis, but my understanding is that insurance has denied coverage for this test. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows losses involving chr. 9, 13 and 18q, and a possible loss of the peri-centromeric area on chr. 10p. Losses involving chromosomes 9 and 10 are common in melanoma. The loss involving chr. 9 was not accentuated in the area of 9p that contains CDKN2A, making it unlikely that there is a homozygous deletion. This correlates with the preservation of p16 staining by immunohistochemistry.  Given the ulceration, histopathologic findings and the results of comparative genomic hybridization, I would regard this as a relatively high risk atypical Spitz tumor, if not spitzoid melanoma. It would be advantageous to also have the results of hTERT promoter testing.","There is an ulcerated, mostly intradermal proliferation of large, oval and fusiform melanocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm and large, vesicular nuclei. These cells are present in confluent fascicles and sheets, with scattered relatively deep mitotic figures and little maturation or dispersion with descent. There is retention of p16 staining.",M,11.0,,,,,,1682818.0
17-61001,OK,,17-61001,17-61001,A,17-61001,L,A,ATYPICAL SPITZ TUMOR,"Much of the lesion has a composition of classic Spitz cells, with a portion (including bulbous aggregations that protrude into the deep reticular dermis) that are composed of pulverocytes*. The latter raises the possibility of additional transformation, vs. the presence of a combined deep penetrating nevic component. This is not supported by a beta catenin immunostain, which shows only cytoplasmic membranous staining, and not nuclear staining, as we have seen in a proportion of deep penetrating nevi (manuscript in press, Nature Genetics). There is nearly complete loss of p16 staining, which can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasm, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16 is located. This loss of staining can also occur by epigenetic means, and is not entirely specific for melanoma.  A phosphohistone H3/MART-1/tyrosinase two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows at least one deep mitotic figure and several superficial melanocytes with positive nuclei.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a loss involving chr. 9, but not in a pattern that would correlate with homozygous loss of CDKN2A, which encodes p16. There are near-threshold gains and losses around the centromere of chr. 10. These do not have breakpoints around known melanoma-associated genes. Dr. Boris Bastian also viewed the chr. 10 results, and would not make a diagnosis of melanoma based on them.  Following the same microdissection and DNA extraction for CGH, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  Given these findings, an atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. The value of the latter is questionable, especially given the results of the multi-center trial just reported in N. Engl. J. Med. 2017 Jun 8;376(23):2211-2222.

The hybridization shows gain of chr. 6p, and a loss involving an area on chr. 6q with the ARID1B gene near its breakpoint. Gain of 6p and loss of 6q are commonly found together in melanoma, and the finding of a breakpoint at a gene important in melanomagenesis further supports that diagnosis. The biopsy and re-excision from this lesion correlate for an approximate thickness of 6 mm. A beta-catenin immunostain labels not only the cytoplasm of the lesional melanocytes but also their nuclei. This supports the assessment of a deep penetrating nevic lineage, per a recent study from our group. This lineage includes deep penetrating nevus, indeterminate lesions, and deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma.  In the re-excision, the neoplasm was a fraction of a mm. from the deep margin near the center of the specimen, and a further excision (still deeper, but not necessary wider) seems warranted.

The focus of necrosis, and high proliferation rate were features worrisome for a deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma. This diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular studies. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows loss of chr. 10, which is a highly characteristic chromosomal copy number change seen in melanoma, with gains in both chr. 11p and 11q (the gain in chr. 11p is of higher amplitude). The former hints at an h-ras mutation. While h-ras mutated Spitz's nevi have isolated chr. 11p gains, and behave benignly, the presence of additional changes in this case means that its presence does not favor benignity. There is also a loss involving chr. 13q.  My colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh also viewed the comparative genomic hybridization results, and the sections and agreed with this diagnosis.

Lesions of this type often involve local lymph nodes, but seldom have distant metastases. Because of the lack of predictive value, sentinel lymph node biopsy can lead to over-treatment.

Per your request, we completed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) as part of our assessment. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in distal chromosome 6q with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. Loss in chromosome 6q can be seen in association with melanoma but typically involves the MYB gene; in this instance, the loss of 6q may fall distal to the MYB gene locus. There is not gain in chromosome 11p present, and thus an HRAS-mutated Spitz nevus can be excluded from diagnostic consideration.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with CGH has not produced an entirely straightforward result. The differential diagnosis lies between an atypical Spitz nevus/tumor with associated distal chromosome 6q loss on one hand and spitzoid melanoma of 3.4 mm in thickness on the other. As melanoma cannot be excluded from the differential diagnosis, I believe that melanoma should be considered the functional diagnosis for this case.

However, many of the lesional melanocytes are pulverocytes* and some nuclei near the base of the specimen have strikingly atypical nuclei. Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. There is a small interstitial deletion in chr. 4q of unknown significance. Areas of loss involving chr. 9q are present. Losses involving chr. 9 or 9p are the most common aberrations in melanoma; losses of 9q with preservation of 9p are less common and seem less significant. A small interstitial gain within chr. 10q is present. The most important aberration is a cluster of high level amplifications and losses involving chr. 12q. These include an amplification that my colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh pointed out to me includes the CDK4 locus. In past work from our group, gains of CDK4 were seen in melanomas that were wild type for b-raf and n-ras.

Immunostaining with p16 demonstrates diffuse preserved expression, and this staining result implies that the loss of CDKN2A function (and loss of p16 expression) that can be seen n association with many examples of melanoma is not apparent here (this finding was borne out by molecular assessment, as is discussed in the paragraph that follows).

A detailed molecular analysis of the latter entity has not yet been completed, but chromosomal copy number abnormalities would likely be infrequent in that context (given that it is said to be a low-risk tumor). To attempt to clarify the diagnosis, we additionally completed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number abnormalities, as would be expected with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed a focused deletion involving chromosome 5q as a monoaberration with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. (The deletion in chromosome 5q includes the APC gene, which is part of the WNT signaling pathway.) As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. In summary, the combination of results derived from aCGH has not produced confirmation of a molecular diagnosis of melanoma. Although it is impossible to exclude melanoma on histopathologic grounds, the molecular result that has been obtained suggests that this tumor may be of ambiguous or low-grade biologic potential. In short, classification as a paraganglioma-like melanocytic tumor (or as a similar form of low-grade tumor) can be considered plausible from a molecular standpoint.

To further explore the nature of this proliferation, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis to screen for genomic copy number anomalies. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in distal chromosome 7q as a monoaberration with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. The area of gain includes the BRAF gene, but there is no indication of a BRAF gene fusion. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The identification of monoaberrations is generally considered non-supportive of the diagnosis of melanoma. Additionally, the aCGH tracing does not demonstrate loss in chromosome 9p, thus indicating that the loss of p16 expression that has been demonstrated is likely epigenetic in nature. After completion of aCGH, BAP-1 immunohistochemistry was additionally completed. Strong expression was observed, indicating that loss of this tumor suppressor protein has not occurred (this corroborates the normal result observed with respect to chromosome 3p in the aCGH tracing). In summary, the interpretation of this tumor is not straightforward. Summing all of the available findings, we have defined a spitzoid melanocytic tumor that has epigenetic loss of p16 expression and that has an associated genomic monoaberration involving distal chromosome 7q. This combination suggests that this tumor does not represent childhood spitzoid melanoma but rather represents a partially transformed Spitz tumor ('atypical Spitz tumor').

Immunostaining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively low proliferation index. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain shows partial retention of that tumor suppressor gene product. BAP-1 staining is also preserved (this can be lost in a subset of Spitzoid proliferations). To assess whether this may reflect an emerging class of Spitzoid neoplasms with genetic fusion events, I also examined ALK and NTRK-1 which are not overexpressed. For further assessment of this proliferation, to exclude the possibility of Spitzoid melanoma, I was interested in obtaining comparative genomic hybridization on this case. This is a technique that assesses chromosomal gains or losses, which (with the exception of a gain of 11p, and few other specific, less common aberrations) are found in melanoma and not in Spitz's nevus. Dr. Timothy McCalmont, also reviewed these sections and agreed with this assessment.  We subsequently received your message authorizing comparative genomic hybridization and this has now been completed. The results are unusual but do not support a diagnosis of melanoma, nor is there an 11p gain as in some Spitz's nevi. I asked my colleagues Drs. Bastian and Yeh, of our molecular unit, to analyze these findings further. There are a complex array of small gains and losses involving a portion of chromosome 7q mainly, and a loss of a portion of 12p. Such anomalies have not been characterized or associated with a specific melanocytic entity to date. Thus, an atypical nevus is likely.

Your submitted phosphohistone immunostain labels melanocytes in mitosis, most of which appear to be intraepidermal in distribution. We additionally completed p16 and BAP-1 immunostains as part of our assessment. The p16 stain demonstrates partial loss of expression, and thus hemizygous loss of chromosome 9p may be present in this tumor. The BAP-1 stain demonstrates loss of nuclear positivity in a subset of large epithelioid cells within this polymorphic tumor, and this labeling result indicates that BAP-1 genomic loss has occurred. In short, I believe this biopsy demonstrates melanoma ex 'BAPoma'.  Deletions (or loss) in BAP-1 can be detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and the presence of genomic loss can also be inferred by the identification of loss of nuclear BAP-1 expression by immunoperoxidase staining, as has been demonstrated here. Loss of BAP-1 can be accompanied by mutations in the remaining BAP-1 allele, which can be somatically acquired or inherited (germline). Inherited mutations of BAP-1 have recently been associated with a new cancer susceptibility syndrome, which is characterized by the occurrence of multiple skin-colored papules in affected individuals, only a minority of which develop uveal or cutaneous melanoma. Affected family members have had many (5 to >50) of the clinically innocuous yet histopathologically distinct melanocytic tumors, whereas there were few melanomas, suggesting that malignant potential is very low. Independently, germline mutations of BAP-1 have also been reported to be associated with familial mesothelioma.  The significance of this tumor in this patient needs to be judged in the larger familial context. If this is a solitary papule in a patient with no other similar lesions, then the BAP-1 alteration may be sporadic. If this patient has multiple similar papules or if there are similar papules in other family members, then the possibility of an underlying syndrome (with germline mutation) may be deserving of further consideration.

Molecular assessment (the results of which are discussed below) was initiated on July 29, 2015. Data became available during the subsequent week, and my final interpretation of the molecular data was completed on August 7, 2015. As I have discussed with you, this biopsy demonstrates a configuration that fits with a diagnosis of 'NTRK1-oma', namely a Spitz nevus/tumor with associated NTRK1 gene fusion. NTRK1 immunohistochemistry has been completed and demonstrates remarkable positivity, and this labeling result implies that underlying NTRK1 gene fusion has occurred. Gene fusion is merely a mechanism of tumor development and does not provide information regarding clinical behavior, but my impression, based upon histopathologic characteristics, is that this tumor is only partially transformed and thus holds no adverse clinical implications.  Given the high clinical concern, we completed ancillary assessment to further substantiate the nature of this tumor. This was completed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as would be expected with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed no chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, I believe this tumor is unusual but essentially equivalent to a melanocytic nevus. Dr. Rosenman should follow the site to verify that no persistence ensues, if no reexcision is planned.  Please note that I have also retrospectively reviewed a 2012 biopsy from this patient as part of my evaluation. My retrospective diagnosis for the prior specimen is that it demonstrates a 'pagetoid' pigmented spindle cell nevus. Some tumors within the spectrum of pigmented spindle cell nevus are induced by NTRK1 gene fusion, and thus it is conceivable that this patient's prior tumor and current tumor are mechanistically related. We understand that the old tissue block has been exhausted, and thus no further testing in that regard will be possible.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology.

IN THICKNESS","The features seemed in part to be a mixture of those of a Spitz's nevus and those of a superficial congenital nevus, but some raised the possibility of a nevoid melanoma, necessitating additional studies. As some Spitz's nevi with cells that have less cytoplasm than usual have NTRK1 gene fusions, I obtained that immunostain, but the strong staining seen in that situation is not present. A p16 immunostain shows that this tumor suppressor protein is retained only in a minority of cells, but these are distributed evenly, and not in a pattern suggesting loss of p16 in a clonal population, as could reflect bi-allelic loss of CDKN2A as would favor melanoma. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) has now been repeated (the first try resulted in a slide in which much of the tissue had fallen off), and shows a marginal mitosis as well as one in the mid-portion of the lesion.  Marginal mitoses are mentioned in the reference below as a finding favoring melanoma over Spitz's nevus, and also emerged in the results of an expert panel in 2008 evaluating melanocytic neoplasms of unknown malignant potential.  Given this finding, I suggested comparative genomic hybridization, which has now been completed. It shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. These include loss of chr. 1p, chr. 2, gain of 4q, loss of 5, gain of 6p and loss of 6q, gains of 7 and 8, losses of 9 and 10, loss of 13, gain of 15, loss of 16 and gain of 19. Many of these are copy number changes often found in melanoma.  A recent study from St. Jude's Medical Center, referenced below suggests that hTERT mutation analysis is more important than chromosomal copy number changes in determining the potential for childhood spitzoid melanomas to spread beyond local nodes. In this case, this may not be as important, as the morphology is more nevoid than spitzoid. This testing is not commercially available, but we hope to have it set up in our lab in several months time. In the interim, it is available at St. Jude's, but only for patients being seen there clinically.  References:  Crotty KA. Spitz naevus: histological features and distinction from malignant melanoma.

Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows an interstitial loss flanking the BAP-1 gene on chr. 3p, and what appears to be a bi-allelic loss involving CDKN2A on chr. 9p. The latter is indicative of melanoma. A BAP-1 immunostain shows no loss of nuclear positivity. Given the results of comparative genomic hybridization, this could indicate the loss of one allele, and a mutation of the other allele of BAP-1 that produces a protein that is mutated, but still can bind the antibody. Staining for p16 shows a very low positivity rate, in keeping with the loss of CDKN2A by CGH.  The findings contrast with those seen in proliferative nodules, in which there are gains or losses of whole chromosomes.  ADDENDUM, October 14, 2015: I re-evaluated the comparative genomic hybridization array graph, and the interstitial deletion noted above is in chr. 4p, not 3p. This does not affect the diagnosis, given the bi-allelic loss in 9p around CDKN2A, but does explain why there was no loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry.","Sections show a large, oval mass of large, oval melanocytes, some with a plasmacytoid appearance, with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, pleomorphic vesicular nuclei with coarse chromatin.

One population was composed of relatively small epithelioid melanocytes that diminished in size with descent and that were located mostly at the periphery of the proliferation. The other population was composed of large epithelioid melanocytes, many with atypical nuclei and some in mitosis, that formed large nests and near sheets within the central aspect of the specimen. This central population of melanocytes was concerning for Spitzoid melanoma while the peripheal population was suggestive of a Spitz nevus. In order to further evaluate this neoplasm, I performed immunoperoxidase staining. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) demonstrates a non-trivial number of melanocytes in mitosis within the dermal component of this proliferation.  Staining with p16 demonstrates significant loss of p16 staining among melanocytes within the central aspect of the proliferation (i.e. those concerning for Spitzoid melanoma) but no loss in the peripheral melanocytes. This loss can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasm, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16, is located. This loss of staining can also occur by epigenetic means, and is not entirely specific for melanoma. Nonetheless, detection of this loss within the morphologically atypical melanocytes is concerning. While I favored a Spitzoid melanoma arising in a Spitz nevus for the above mentioned reasons, I did not think that an unequivocal diagnosis could be rendered based on the above data. Therefore, after receiving authorization from the clinical team, I (1) completed FISH analysis for chromosome 9p in order to determine if the loss of p16 staining mentioned above represented an authentic mutation in this genetic locus of an epigenetic phenomenon and (2) completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) since FISH analysis only tests for one genetic locus.  The FISH testing did not show homozygous loss of chromosome 9p and thus the loss of p16 appears to be an epigenetic phenomenon.  The aCGH reveals a small sub-centromeric gain on chromosome 1q, a loss on chromosome 6q and a gain of chromosome 21q. The loss on chromosome 1 is bordered by TPM3, which is a gene involved in a range of fusions, and thus it is possible that a fusion has occurred. While the presence of these three abnormalities detected on the aCGH is worrisome, it is not sufficiently atypical to render an unequivocal diagnosis of Spitzoid melanoma. I think it is best to regard this lesion as representing an atypical Spitz tumor, which is a Spitzoid neoplasm that shows more atypicality than a conventional Spitz tumor but is not sufficiently atypical to warrant an unequivocal diagnosis of Spitzoid melanoma. Fusions occur relatively frequently in atypical Spitz tumors, which might have been the case herein.  Given that this proliferation extends to the base and peripheral aspect of the specimen, I think that it should be re-excised with a few millimeters of a margin.  My colleagues, Dr. Timothy McCalmont and Boris Bastian, also reviewed these sections and agree with this assessment.","Sections show a compound proliferation of spitzoid melanocytes.

In light of this, I recommended molecular analysis via either comparative genomic hybridization or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as would be expected with melanoma. After receipt of payor authorization, we proceed with array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).

Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations.  Following the above DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization, and found losses involving chrs. 9 and 10. These are commonly found in melanoma. The chr. 9 loss appears to be heterozygous, as p16 is preserved by immunohistochemistry. Putting this all together, the maturation and dispersion with descent, and absence of hTERT promoter mutation are against a fully malignant neoplasm while the comparative genomic hybridization result somewhat favors melanoma, but not as much as if there was a homozygous chr. 9 or 9p loss.  An atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.

The cells of interest are positive with S100 protein, in keeping with a schwannoma, but an epithelial membrane antigen positive capsule is not present with that stain. Also, there are no cellular (Antoni A) and myxoid, less cellular (Antoni B) areas, and a small focus features melanophages. Neurofilament protein immunostaining is negative, unlike the case in palisaded and encapsulated neuroma (which should also have an EMA positive capsule). There is focal positivity with two melanocytic markers, Melan-A and HMB45. The latter is positive in fewer cells than would be expected in a cellular blue nevus. A p16 stain shows large areas with only a few positive cells, and some with none, worrisome for melanoma. A focally elevated Ki-67 cell proliferation index is present. ALK was obtained, given the long fascicles, but is negative (unlike the case in spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms with ALK gene fusions). A p53 immunoperoxidase stain does not show aberrant expression. Mutation of TP53 and overexpression of p53 is uncommon in primary melanomas in general, but occurs in many desmoplastic melanomas, which some aspects of this case raised.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple aberrations, including a gain involving chr. 2q, gains involving chr. 4p, gains and losses involving chr. 9, and a gain involving chr. 15q. The loss involving chr. 9 includes two levels in the CDKN2A area, suggesting a homozygous loss, worrisome for melanoma; there may also be a rearrangement involving NTRK3. The genomic data were also reviewed by my colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh.  Given these results, I believe that this neoplasm should be treated in a manner adequate for a low grade melanoma/melanocytic tumor of unknown malignant potential, with complete excision (the lesion in these sections is an oval mass with essentially positive margins around much of it.",There is a well-circumscribed oval mass composed of spindled cells with monomorphous nuclei and inconspicuous cytoplasm disposed as relatively closely apposed fascicles.,M,29.0,,,,,,1617429.0

Most of the melanocytes have spindled nuclei with amphophilic cytoplasm. Given the long, vertically oriented fascicles in the dermis, I obtained NTRK-1 and ALK immunoperoxidase stains. These genes can be involved in a gene fusion, with resultant overexpression in a subset of Spitz's nevi with this morphologic finding. The stains are negative in this case, however. The differential diagnosis includes an atypical pigmented spindle cell nevus or plexiform spindle cell nevus, atypical Spitz tumor, and spitzoid melanoma. Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) does not show significant pagetoid scatter in the MART-1 component beyond what was evident in the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, and the Ki-67 proliferation rate of the lesional melanocytes is around 5%. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product. Given the ambiguous findings in the routine sections and immunoperoxidase workup, I obtained comparative genomic hybridization to assess for melanoma associated chromosomal abnormalities. This showed multiple chromosomal gains and losses including 1p and 8q loss, 7p and 15q gain, a complex pattern of both gains and losses on 7q including findings that suggest a BRAF fusion event, and an isolated interstitial deletion involving a portion of chromosome 3p containing the BAP-1 gene. Analysis for a tert promoter mutation was negative.  Given the genetic findings of multiple chromosomal gains and losses, including regions frequently seen in melanoma, I believe the best diagnosis for this case is a spitzoid melanoma and not an atypical Spitz tumor. I shared this case with my colleague Dr. Philip LeBoit who agrees with this interpretation.

Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations.  Based on these findings, I favor an atypical Spitz tumor. These are neoplasms that have features more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.

The stain was performed as some blue nevus-like melanoma show BAP-1 loss due to mutation in one allele and loss of part or all of chromosome 3p or chr. 3. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product (nearly complete or complete loss in a defined zone is worrisome for melanoma).  I did not find mitotic figures in dermal melanocytes in a phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunostain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle), a finding against melanoma. The stain did show a minor junctional component and a few melanocytes scattered singly above the junction, against a cellular blue nevus.  Given this latter finding, I favor an unusually mitotically quiescent melanoma, and advise re-excision on that basis, despite the difficulties at this site. The thickness in these sections is problematic, given that only a tiny portion of epidermis is included, and the pieces are not optimally oriented. I estimate the thickness as about 2 mm.

Phosphohistone-H3 staining demonstrates that the mitotic index is significantly elevated (4 per square millimeter). BAP-1 expression is preserved, and thus a so-called 'BAPoma' has been excluded from the differential diagnosis. Immunostaining with p16 demonstrates partial mosaic immunopositivity; since there is significant loss of expression in a superficial nodular area, we additionally completed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to better assess the copy number status of the CDKN2A locus. No copy number loss was identified in the CDKN2A FISH assessment, and this implies that the loss of p16 expression documented by immunohistochemistry is probably epigenetic in nature (and thus it cannot be taken as being diagnostically meaningful). Given the elevated mitotic index, my differential diagnosis included an ambiguous/indeterminate Spitz tumor on one hand and pediatric spitzoid melanoma on the other. The best current means to comprehensively evaluate the nature of a proliferation such as this one is to complete array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for copy number anomalies throughout the genome. After receipt of payor authorization, we thus initiated aCGH assessment. This consisted of microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block and application of aCGH, which demonstrated gain in chromosome 4p as well as loss in chromosomes 4q, 5q, 9q, 16q, and 22q. The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number abnormalities indicates genomic instability, as is stereotypical of melanoma.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has provided support for a diagnosis of pediatric spitzoid melanoma. The AJCC staging parameters that are applied to the assessment of adult melanoma are not known to be reflective of prognosis in the pediatric setting. With that said, for the sake of completeness, please note that this relatively thick tumor is non-ulcerated. As noted above, the mitotic index is 4 per square millimeter.

The ALK stain is negative, excluding that variant of spitzoid neoplasm. There is a mosaic pattern of staining for p16, sufficient to exclude the possibility of a bi-allelic deletion of chr. 9p, which can be found in melanoma (the absence of which does not exclude the diagnosis, however).  The differential diagnosis included an atypical Spitz tumor and spitzoid melanoma.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi. These included gains involving chromosomes 2p, 3p, 4p, and 8q and losses involving 3q and 4q. C-myc is on chr. 8q, and gains of this chromosome are a repeatable aberration in melanoma, while many of the other aberrations are not.  Currently, I use the term spitzoid melanoma, childhood type, for an emerging class of lesions that usually but not exclusively occur in children and teens, lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas in adults) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. These are findings that would support conservative treatment. Most lesions of this type are deeper, but usually not much wider than their exophytic portions, and even when they are, are well circumscribed. While sentinel nodes are often positive, this positivity has much less predictive value for systemic spread than is the case with adult melanoma.

A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product (nearly complete or complete loss in a defined zone is worrisome for melanoma).  Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively low proliferation rate in the junctional component and a moderately elevated proliferation rate in a mid-portion of the dermal component. The MART-1/tyrosinase component does not reveal more suprabasilar scatter than could be seen in the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections.  The findings are peculiar, and in another setting, I would consider complete excision. There may be a role for adjunctive testing, and follow up rather than excision if the results point to a benign lesion. I would be happy to discuss this with you.  ADDENDUM, July  6, 2016:  Per your message, we will proceed with comparative genomic hybridization. Results are usually available in 3-4 weeks.  ADDENDUM #2, July 30, 2016:  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a gain involving an area on distal chr. 7q, with a breakpoint within the b-raf gene. We have seen this pattern in Spitz nevi with braf gene fusions (e.g. fusions of b-raf with another partner on the same chromosome). These fusions activate b-raf transcription, and are much rarer than are b-raf mutations. While b-raf gene fusions can occasionally occur in melanoma, these are very rare and would be expected to be accompanied by other chromosomal copy number changes. Also, the morphology of some of these cases has had single melanocytes permeating the deep reticular dermis similar to the appearance here.  The neoplasm extends to the base of the specimen. Given this result by comparative genomic hybridization, I favor an unusual nevus with some spitzoid features. I believe that the site could be periodically followed.","Sections show a compound proliferation of melanocytes arrayed as a few small nests along the epidermal-dermal junction, and as nests, cords and strands that extend into the superficial reticular dermis and are distributed around adnexa.

Rather, this tumor shows many histopathologic features that were considered worrisome for nevoid melanoma with pseudomaturation. The gargantuan nests of melanocytes that are present superficially and the elevated mitotic index are both features that were considered to be of concern. I additionally considered the possibility of an epidermotropic metastasis of melanoma in my differential diagnosis. However, that would only be germane in the context of a patient with an existing history of melanoma and thus can be excluded in the interpretation of this specimen. To add additional diagnostic information, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss, as can be seen in association with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 11p as well as loss in chromone 22q with no other associated genomic gains or losses. Loss in chromosome 22q is a rare molecular finding and is likely of no larger significance. Gain in chromosome 11p has been identified in a subset of Spitz tumors and is highly correlated with underlying HRAS mutation.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH suggests that this proliferation represents an HRAS-mutated Spitz tumor rather than a frank melanoma. What is unusual about this case is that the microscopic findings are quite different from most examples of that entity. With that said, the molecular findings seem clear cut. Long-term follow-up studies of HRAS-mutated Spitz tumors suggests that they are functionally benign and thus are of no larger clinical significance. As the deep edge of this biopsy is involved, conservative reexcision is recommended to be certain that full local removal has been accomplished.

Your submitted immunostain for p16 shows partial loss of expression, and this finding is diagnostically inconclusive (although a loss of chromosome 9 was ultimately confirmed to be present, as is discussed in the paragraph that follows). To further evaluate this tumor, we completed phosphohistone-H3 immunostaining to assess the mitotic index. In the resultant immunostain, rather dramatic maturation is apparent, and only a small number of perijunctional melanocytes in mitosis can be identified. To clarify the differential diagnosis, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosomes 12p and 15q as well as loss in chromosomes 1p, 2p, centromeric 7p, 9, centromeric 12q, 13q, 17, and 18. The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number abnormalities indicates genomic instability, as is typical of melanoma.

Immunostaining demonstrated mosaic expression of p16, and thus biallelic loss in CDKN2A is not present in association with this tumor (the fact that there is not CDKN2A loss at all was subsequently documented by molecular methods, as is discussed in the paragraph that follows). An ALK stain is negative, and thus underlying ALK gene fusion is not present. My residual differential included an HRAS-mutated desmoplastic Spitz nevus, and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was completed to fully clarify the diagnosis. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 11p as a monoaberration with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The identification of gain in chromosome 11p is highly correlated with HRAS mutation, and this finding corroborates the diagnosis of HRAS-mutated Spitz nevus.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, our analysis confirms that this represents a variant of Spitz nevus, namely a Spitz nevus with HRAS mutation and gain.

As all of the molecular findings are of low amplitude, the observed results do not support interpretation as frank spitzoid melanoma. The most significant finding is loss in chromosome 9; this can be seen in melanoma as well as in histopathologically ambiguous proliferations within the spectrum of 'atypical Spitz tumor'. I believe the latter categorization represents the best classification for this proliferation.

After microdissection of the key area of the tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, the application of aCGH revealed gain in centromeric chromosome 1p, loss in telomeric chromosome 1q, gain and loss in chromosome 7q with associated chromothripsis, and loss in chromosome 9. A marked focal gain in chromosome 7q is apparent at the location of BRAF, and this is probably an indicator of BRAF gene fusion.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with immunohistochemistry and aCGH suggests that frank spitzoid melanoma is not present here. Rather, we have identified an emerging spitzoid clone characterized by loss in CDKN2A and BRAF gene fusion. The secondary clone is best categorized as an 'atypical Spitz tumor', and the case as a whole can be viewed as an 'atypical Spitz tumor' arising focally within a Spitz nevus. With respect to management, the tumor appears narrowly excised in the current planes of section. Clinical follow-up of the surgical site is warranted, at a minimum (to verify that no persistence ensues), and additional excision can also be considered to ensure local removal.

Some of the constituent cells are extremely large with plasmacytoid or epithelioid morphology.

A BAP-1 immunostain labels the nuclei of keratinocytes in the overlying epidermis, those of lymphocytes and those of the smaller melanocytes, but not the larger, spitzoid ones. This is consistent with BAP-1 loss in the larger spitzoid cells. This loss can be due to mutation in one allele and loss of the other, or to epigenetic mechanisms.  A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product (nearly complete or complete loss in a defined zone is worrisome for melanoma). As loss of p16 can follow BAP-1 loss in multi-step progression toward melanoma, this is a reassuring finding.  A phosphohistone H3/MART-1/tyrosinase two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows up to four mitotic figures in dermal melanocytes/section.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows only an interstitial loss in chr. 3p around the area of the BAP-1 gene, and no other gains or losses. This is against progression toward melanoma.  Using the DNA extracted for this procedure, we performed sequencing of the hTERT promoter gene. This test detects TERT promoter mutations on chromosome 5 between nucleotides 1,295,155 to 1,295,355; including mutations at g.1295161 A>C; g.1295228 C>T; g.1295250 C>T. Such mutations occur in melanoma, and in the context of atypical spitzoid neoplasms have been linked to the capacity for spread beyond local lymph nodes. No mutations were found, lessening concern regarding the chance for such spread. In the study cited below, the only cases with fatal outcomes were in patients who had hTERT promoter mutations. Since then, there have been a few cases in which hTERT promoter mutations were not found, but in which the gene was affected by promoter methylation.  In sum, the findings are those of an atypical Spitz tumor with BAP-1 loss, but not progression toward a BAP-1 deficient spitzoid melanoma. A narrow re-excision of this site would still be prudent, as lesions with BAP-1 loss may convert to melanoma at a higher rate than other spitzoid neoplasms.

Our analysis (as delineated in the paragraphs that follow) indicates that metastatic melanoma can be considered excluded, although that phenomenon was entertained as a potential consideration in the differential diagnosis. Rather than melanoma, I favor interpretation as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). With respect to immunoperoxidase staining results, EMA shows considerable positivity, as can be seen in the context of peripheral nerve sheath tumors. There is a paucity of p16 expression, which was taken as being indicative of CDKN2A genomic loss (this has been borne out by molecular analysis, as is discussed in the next paragraph). INI-1 and H3K27me3 immunostains both show retained nuclear expression (loss of either can be seen in some examples of MPNST). In short, the immunohistochemical profile is not decisively diagnostic.  Simultaneously, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss. Direct genetic comparison with the papular melanocytic tumor removed from this patient in 2012 was not possible, as it was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) rather than by aCGH. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosomes 5p, 6, 7, 8, telomeric 9q, 13q, 16, 19, 20, and 21q. There is also subthreshold gain in chromosomes 11 and 12. Additionally, genomic loss was identified in chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5q, 9p (correlating with the p16 staining result), 10p, centromeric 10q, 14q, and 18. Because of the tremendous number of gains and losses, it is possible that the software had trouble localizing the log0 baseline; while this could shift the magnitude of some of the observed aberrations, it would not affect the number of aberrations observed. Please note that a number of the defined genomic aberrations are uncommon in association with melanoma. Based upon comparison with genomic results we have observed in a data set of >2000 analyzed tumors, the genomic profile that we have defined is not compatible with a diagnosis of melanoma. Dr. Boris Bastian reviewed the molecular data and agrees with that conclusion.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with immunohistochemistry and aCGH indicate that this malignancy does not represent melanoma or metastatic melanoma; . Given the fact that the tumor cells avidly express SOX-10 and S100 protein, MPNST becomes the foremost alternative in the differential diagnosis, although the immunophenotype of this tumor, using newer reagents, is not necessarily prototypical of MPNST.  Slide D14-14251C has additionally been reviewed and demonstrates a papular melanocytic nevus; it is unrelated to the changes observed in the 2016 specimen. The slides from case DL12-57813 have also been re-reviewed; I can simply state that the small melanocytic proliferation seen in the 2012 specimen has a different immunophenotype from that defined in association with the 2016 specimen and that the 2012 findings are not obviously supportive of a diagnosis of melanoma on histopathologic grounds.

Your submitted phosphohistone-H3 immunostain demonstrates that the mitotic index is low, but this finding is of little diagnostic comfort, as the mitotic rate in many examples of nevoid melanoma approaches zero. Immunohistochemistry for p16 was additionally completed and demonstrates mosaic positivity, and this implies that biallelic loss in CDKN2A is not apparent in this tumor. (If biallelic loss was present, it would compellingly favor the diagnosis of melanoma.) The defined findings were certainly plausible as an atypical melanocytic nevus, but I did not feel that nevoid melanoma of 0.75 mm in thickness could be excluded on histopathologic grounds. In light of this and as per your authorization, we additionally completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss, as would be expected in association with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 7q with loss of telomeric chromosome 6q (not involving the MYB gene) with no other associated gains or losses. The gain in chromosome 7q includes a spike in the vicinity of 7q34, and this finding suggests that BRAF gene fusion has occurred. As background for fully understanding the molecular result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated significant chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations or show a monoaberration, as is apparent here (the loss of telomeric 6q is trivial and is not of larger diagnostic significance, and thus the gain in 7q qualifies as a monoaberration).  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced confirmation of a diagnosis of nevoid melanoma. Rather, I believe the proliferation represents a partially transformed melanocytic nevus with underlying BRAF gene fusion. Returning to the slide after analyzing the molecular findings, there are subtle spitzoid characteristics that I did not fully appreciate in my prior evaluation. Based upon these findings coupled with the molecular result, I believe this melanocytic nevus is best categorized within the spectrum of Spitz nevus.  Gene fusion, including BRAF gene fusion, represents a not uncommon mechanism of induction of Spitz nevi and Spitz tumors. Such tumors are only minimally or partially transformed and typically hold no larger clinical potential. With that said, as this biopsy is only partial in nature, conservative complete reexcision can be considered as follow-up management. The intent of reexcision is simply to ensure complete removal and verify that persistence with additional transformation cannot ensue.

However, there is nearly complete loss of p16 staining, which can correlate with one of the common genomic aberrations seen in melanocytic neoplasm, bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p, where the gene, CDKN2A that encodes p16 is located. This loss of staining can also occur by epigenetic means, and is not entirely specific for melanoma.  Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization.  It shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi.

As is discussed in the paragraphs that follow, the diagnosis of HRAS-mutated Spitz nevus has now been confirmed. Ancillary analysis was recommended and has been completed, as per your authorization. Immunohistochemistry for p16 was completed to assess (or infer) the copy number status of CDKN2A, and mosaic immunopositivity has been demonstrated; this implies that significant genomic loss in CDKN2A has not occurred. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was additionally completed to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss throughout the genome. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed isolated gain in chromosome 11p as a monoaberration with no additional chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The identification of isolated gain in chromosome 11p corresponds to mutation in HRAS and can be considered confirmatory of the above diagnosis.

Some relatively deep mitotic figures are present as well. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a complex pattern of gains and losses on chr. 3p including an amplification of an area around MiTF. While the area of loss encompassed the BAP-1 gene on chr. 3p, no loss of BAP-1 was seen by immunohistochemistry, making it unlikely that a BAP-1 mutation was present. MiTF amplifications are usually found in high grade melanomas, and seldom in spitzoid lesions in children. There is a loss of chr. 6q, and a gain of chr. 7. A gain of part of chr. X is also present.

This unusual tumor includes both conventional melanocytic nevus and a secondary component resembling a deep penetrating nevus, and the latter component exhibits associated neurotropism and adnexotropism. Your immunoperoxidase stains demonstrate that expression of p16 is generally preserved and that the Ki-67 cell proliferation index is low, and both of these labeling results are as would be expected with a melanocytic nevus, or at least do not provide clear support to interpretation as melanoma. Immunostaining for beta catenin was included in our evaluation and is negative. Some but not all examples of deep penetrating nevus exhibit nuclear positivity with beta catenin immunohistochemistry, as activating mutations in beta catenin are common to their pathogenesis.  In terms of potential considerations in the differential diagnosis, I found myself unable to render a diagnosis of neurotropic melanoma (arising in conjunction with a melanocytic nevus) on histopathologic grounds, but obviously the finding of marked neurotropism is extreme and unusual. To clarify the diagnosis, we additionally completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number gain or loss, as per your authorization. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in chromosome 1p, focal loss in telomeric chromosome 2q, and gain in telomeric chromosome 7q, including the region where BRAF is encoded. This unusual molecular result with multiple small aberrations does not provide support to interpretation as frank melanoma but also indicates that this proliferation does not represent any form of conventional melanocytic nevus.

IN THICKNESS","I agree that the differential diagnosis includes both a nevoid melanoma resembling a dysplastic nevus, and a lesion at the upper end of the spectrum for dysplastic nevus. While the peripheral component is mostly nested, featuring bridging and fibroplasia, there is more pagetoid scatter in the Mart-1 immunostains than could be appreciated in the hematoxylin eosin-stained sections. Also, as you note there is compression of the elastic fiber network, and although the dermal melanocytes are relatively small they have slightly more cytoplasm than in most dysplastic nevi. Given the difficulties of this case, I obtained comparative genomic hybridization to see if chromosomal copy number changes as found in melanoma were present or not. Following microdissection and DNA extraction, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. This showed a gain involving the terminal portion of chr. 2q, and one involving chr. 6p. While the number of chromosomal copy number changes is limited, gain of chr. 6p is highly characteristic of melanoma and in the context of the microscopic findings is, in my opinion, sufficient for a diagnosis of melanoma. I included the larger of the dermal cells in the thickness, but not the small, round melanocytes loosely arranged at the base of the papillary dermis (which may be those of a pre-existent nevus).  Given the absence of ulceration or of mitotic figures in the dermal component, I would assess this as a AJCC stage pT1a melanoma.",The microscopic findings are essentially as described in the accompanying pathology report and in the note above.,F,57.0,T1a,0.6,,Primary,,1780487.0

IN THICKNESS, ARISING IN A NEVUS","The differential diagnosis included a combined deep penetrating nevus, or more likely, a deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma arising in a nevus, or a conventional melanoma arising in one. The the scout section (the hematoxylin and eosin stained recut that we obtain at the time that sections are cut for immunoperoxidase stains) shows two mitotic figures in the large, pale melanocytes, one of them a marginal mitosis. Some strikingly large and irregularly shaped nuclei are present in these cells. The sizes of the nests are larger than in most deep penetrating nevi.  A beta-catenin immunostain labels not only the cytoplasm of the large, pale melanocytes but also their nuclei. This supports the assessment of a deep penetrating nevic lineage, per a recent study from our group. This lineage includes deep penetrating nevus, indeterminate lesions, and deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma.  A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product in either population. A PRAME immunostain is negative. Strong, uniform staining of the nuclei of the lesional melanocytes would have favored melanoma.  Based on the findings in the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, I favor the large cells representing deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma rather than a deep penetrating nevus.

The melanophages usually present in that condition are scant, and there is a zone of verrucous epidermal hyperplasia over it, which is not usually the case. The percentage of cells with Ki-67 positivity is of concern. A beta-catenin immunostain labels not only the cytoplasm of the lesional melanocytes but also a few of their nuclei. This supports the assessment of a deep penetrating nevic lineage, per a recent study from our group. This lineage includes deep penetrating nevus, indeterminate lesions, and deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma.  A high percentage of the nuclei of the lesional melanocytes have from faint to marked positivity for p53. This is of concern for a deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma. One of the cases of that entity in the reference below had a TP53 mutation.  Ideally, we would confirm the diagnosis of a deep penetrating nevus-like melanoma with next generation sequencing, or comparative genomic hybridization coupled with hTERT promoter sequencing. I will in touch re such testing. In its absence, re-excision and follow-up appropriate for a melanoma of at least 2.1 mm. thickness.

This mutation is often accompanied by loss of chromosome 3p or a segment thereof that can be found by comparative genomic hybridization. However, a BAP-1 immunoperoxidase stain shows no loss of nuclear staining in the large melanocytes, and comparative genomic hybridization shows no loss of chromosome 3p. However, there is a gain involving chromosome 1p, a small gain in 7p and a gain in 7q. Gains in 7q can be seen as isolated findings in some Spitz's nevi, but are also common findings in melanoma. Losses of 1p are typical of a variety of malignancies, including melanoma, but gains of 1p, as are present here, are unusual in melanoma. Given that three aberrations are evident, the lesion may have metastatic potential, but I am not convinced that an outright diagnosis of melanoma is appropriate.

Additionally, while the lesion appears to have a flat base at scanning magnification, that base is provided by lymphocytes. When one looks at the contour of the melanocytic proliferation itself, it is quite uneven. A p16 immunostain performed in our laboratory shows a near absence of staining. This can correlate with bi-allelic loss of chr. 9p. or chr. 9, but is not as strong evidence for the genomic loss as would be fluorescence in situ hybridization or comparative genomic hybridization testing. Currently, I use the term Spitzoid melanoma, childhood type, for an emerging class of lesions that usually but not exclusively occur in children and teens, usually lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas in adults) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. These are findings that would support conservative treatment. Most lesions of this type are deeper, but usually not much wider than their exophytic portions, and even when they are, are well circumscribed. While sentinel nodes are often positive, this positivity has much less predictive value for systemic spread than is the case with adult melanoma. Hence, the thickness of 2.1 mm would result in a prognosis that is much more grim than a lesion such as this one would ordinarily have. A narrow re-excision and clinical follow-up is preferable to more aggressive treatment.","There is a proliferation of large oval and fusiform melanocytes that are predominantly situated in the dermis, forming large confluent nests at the junction of an irregularly hyperplastic epidermis with a domed surface.

Favoring a Spitz's nevus were the architectural features of the lesion and the presence of many Kamino bodies. Favoring melanoma are the character of the cytoplasm of the lesional melanocytes and the degree of nuclear pleomorphism of both epidermal and dermal melanocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a low proliferation rate in the dermal component. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows some mitotic figures in the junctional component but not in the dermal component. Both of these are reassuring findings. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain shows nearly complete loss of that tumor suppressor gene product. Comparative genomic hybridization shows multiple chromosomal aberrations pointing to melanoma. There is a gain involving chromosome 1q, and losses involving chromosomes 9, 10 and the distal portion of 11q. The first three are common occurrences in melanoma. The low amplitude of the deviations from the baseline on the comparative genomic hybridization array graph probably reflects normal cell contamination, as the epidermis in the area that was used for comparative genomic hybridization is quite thick (DNA from normal keratinocytes and lymphocytes diluted the DNA from the lesional melanocytes).  The neoplasm extends to the peripheral edge of the specimen. The lesion is less than 1 mm in thickness, is not ulcerated, and does not have detectable mitotic figures in its dermal component. Therefore it should be classified as T1a per the 2009 revision of the AJCC staging system for melanoma.","Sections show a roughly symmetrical compound melanocytic proliferation with a domed surface and a flattish base.

It also contains a somewhat syncytial arrangement of dermal melanocytes. It did not thus display features of a conventional Spitz's nevus by any means. As the differential diagnosis included spitzoid melanoma, such lesions often prompt analysis by comparative genomic hybridization, a molecular technique that uses lesional tissue from the paraffin block.

A reference on this technique and its applicability to this differential diagnosis is listed below. This testing has now been completed, and shows multiple chromosomal aberrations. There is a complete loss of chromosome 9, a finding which on its own may not be of particular significance, but in combination with the other aberrations noted, supports a diagnosis of melanoma.

The BAP-1 stain demonstrated retention of this nuclear protein, excluding the possibility of a BAP-1 inactivated melanocytoma. The p16 stain was also strongly retained in both populations, confirming that biallelic loss of CDKN2A has not occurred. We additionally performed staining for cilia, which has been shown to be lost in conventional melanoma and retained in nevi. This stain also demonstrated a reassuring pattern of cilia retention in both populations (ref).

Rather, to my eye the histopathologic pattern suggests a small cell Spitz nevus induced by kinase gene fusion. More narrowly, I suspect a Spitz nevus induced by MYO5A/NTRK3 gene fusion.

Genomic analysis revealed loss in chromosomes 2p, 6q, 8p, and 12q, and loss of the entirety of chromosome 18 is also apparent. The presence of multiple genomic anomalies points to spitzoid melanoma as the best interpretation. Please note that childhood-type spitzoid melanoma represents an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Cases reported in the literature as malignant Spitz nevus probably represent the same entity. With respect to clinical behavior, there is a risk for extension to regional lymph nodes, but our experience to date suggests that the risk for seeding of widespread metastatic disease is low. This proliferation is narrowly excised in the available sections. Further excision remains warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.  As we reported previously, our differential diagnosis included a cellular epithelioid Spitz nevus on one hand and so-called childhood-type spitzoid melanoma on the other. The latter has now been proven as the diagnosis for this case based upon the results of aCGH analysis. We also completed immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system (with MART-1 labeled red and Ki-67 labeled brown) was included in our evaluation. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. Although the overall labeling index is modest, the MART-positive cells show focally increased nuclear expression of Ki-67, especially in the upper half of the proliferation, thus implying that cellular proliferation is focally elevated. This staining result is diagnostically inconclusive.","Sections show a domed, cellular, laterally demarcated compound proliferation of enlarged epithelioid melanocytes.

Based upon the results derived from conventional microscopy and molecular assessment, I offer the following conclusions:  1. The lack of genomic aberrations, as demonstrated by aCGH analysis, speaks against melanoma as a possibility and favors interpretation as a peculiar melanocytic nevus. I do not believe this lesion should be interpreted as a pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (with respect to that diagnostic term, this proliferation is composed of melanocytes that have distinctly spindled cytomorphology).  2. The lack of mutation in GNAQ or GNA11 suggests that this proliferation fits better on the spectrum of pigmented spindle cell nevus or plexiform spindle cell nevus rather than blue nevus.  3.

The more striking cytologic atypia seen in the lesions that I term spitzoid melanoma of childhood is not evident. Similar lesions to this one have been reported under a variety of names, including atypical Spitz tumor. They tend to involve local (and sentinel) lymph nodes at a relatively high rate, but distant metastasis is unlikely. Given the sharp circumscription of the lesion, one could consider a re-excision of this site, but I have not seen lesions of this type recur when excised by even a few millimeters. With regard to sentinel lymph node biopsy, there is little prognostic information as there is such a disparity between a percent of patients with nodal involvement and distant metastases. Comparative genomic hybridization does not show clear-cut evidence of chromosomal gains or losses. Because deflections were present in the plotted CGH data, we consulted with our former colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian (now chairman of Pathology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Medical Center, New York) who agrees that no definite aberrations are present. The lack of aberrations does not exclude the possibility of melanoma, but makes it less likely (aberrations, especially multiple ones in loci characteristic of conventional melanomas would have resulted in an outright diagnosis of melanoma in this case). If one is looking for a more specific name for a lesion like this one, atypical Spitz tumor may be apt.  Please note that a margin of about a millimeter or so is present between the neoplasm and the peripheral margin. Lesions of this type are usually well circumscribed, and do not recur even with narrow excision margins, if the excision margins are histopathologically proven.

To further assess this differential via molecular means, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss of chromosome 7p as well as focal gain in chromosome 7q. No other chromosomal copy number aberrations were identified. As background, please note that chromosomal copy number aberrations involving multiple chromosomes can be identified in the vast majority of melanomas evaluated via aCGH, while most melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. A subset of Spitz nevi demonstrate aberrations involving a single chromosome, including chromosomes 7, 11, and 15. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced clear support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, I believe this proliferation represents an unconventional Spitz nevus with associated gain in chromosome 7q. My colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian, reviewed the aCGH tracing for this case and is in agreement with my diagnostic interpretation.

The architectural features of the lesion could well be those of a Spitz's nevus, but the setting, in an older patient, in severely sun-damaged skin with, and presence of deep mitotic figures is worrisome. A p16 stain is positive in about 30% of lesional nuclei. Testing with comparative genomic hybridization shows a gain involving much of the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q), and one involving 22q. Although these are not among the very most commonly affected loci in melanoma, gains in both of these areas are seen in a proportion of typical melanomas.  The lesion extends to within 1 mm of the margin in the reticular dermis. It is not ulcerated, and hence is a T3a primary melanoma in the 2009 AJCC staging schema for melanoma.","Sections show markedly sun-damaged skin with a well-circumscribed, wedge-shaped to somewhat rectangular proliferation of melanocytes that mostly involves the dermis.

Given these findings, I was concerned that this is a spitzoid melanoma and not Spitz's nevus. Comparative genomic hybridization shows no loss or gain of chromosomal material. This favors a benign interpretation, or a low grade neoplasm with limited metastatic potential (what some call atypical Spitz tumors). About 95% of conventional melanomas show detectable losses or gains with this technique. However, given the limited nuclear atypia and negative comparative genomic hybridization results, I cannot make a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma.

As this differential diagnosis is best addressed by inclusion of the results of molecular analysis, we pursued comparative genomic hybridization analysis via tissue array methodology (aCGH). After extraction of tumoral DNA, aCGH assessment demonstrated gain in chromosome 7q and no other genomic aberrations. Chromosome 7q gain as a monoaberration does not presently have defined significance. We have observed it in melanocytic tumors interpreted ambiguously. A monoaberration in chromosome 7q is not sufficient to warrant interpretation as childhood-type spitzoid melanoma. In summary, based upon the combination of conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH results, I continue to favor a hypercellular Spitz nevus as most likely. As this interpretation is not unequivocal, further excision of this site is warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished and that persistence cannot ensue.","Sections show a domed, cellular and somewhat asymmetrical compound proliferation of enlarged spindled and epithelioid melanocytes.

Additionally, the striking confluence of junctional nests is of concern.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows no chromosomal gains or losses. Given these findings, I am unable to render a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma, and favor a unusual Spitz's nevus. The lesion appears to have been removed with a margin of about 3 mm on one side. It is very well circumscribed, and lesions of this type seldom recur in the scar from the previous biopsy. Also, it is very common for spitzoid lesions of all types (including benign Spitz nevi) to have small clusters of spitzoid melanocytes in a sentinel lymph node. The predictive value of this finding is very low, and I, for this reason, would not endorse this approach.","There is a well-circumscribed, dome-surfaced proliferation of melanocytes involving the junctional zone and superficial dermis. The base of the lesion is relatively flat, except in a central area where melanocytes extend along the access of an eccrine duct.
