The differential diagnosis also includes a traumatized cellular Spitz nevus. We received the tissue block and utilized it to pursue array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis did not reveal any chromosomal gains or losses. As you probably know, genomic gains and losses can be identified in the vast majority of melanomas, including proliferations within the spectrum of so-called childhood-type spitzoid melanoma. In short, the lack of demonstrable genomic anomalies in this specimen does not provide direct support for a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma. I recommend complete excision of this site in follow-up. If the resultant reexcision specimen does not contain any residuum, then I view a traumatized hypercellular Spitz nevus as the most likely diagnostic possibility. If a nodular residuum is found below the site of the present biopsy, then it should be reassessed jointly with this specimen.","Sections show an ulcerated proliferation of large oval and fusiform melanocytes with a domed surface.

To address this differential, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis demonstrated gain in chromosome 1q and loss of chromosome 6q. The identification of multiple chromosomal gains and losses is not known to occur in Spitz nevi and favors instead the above interpretation. The designation childhood-type spitzoid melanoma refers to an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Such tumors typically lack BRAF mutations and were reported in the past literature under such flawed designations as malignant Spitz nevus. Experience to date suggests a small risk for extension to regional lymph nodes with a low risk for widespread dissemination.  This proliferation has not been adequately excised. Further excision is warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.","Sections show a cellular, exophytic, polypoid compound proliferation of melanocytes. Within the background epidermis, which is thin, there are single melanocytes and nests distributed erratically, and cells above the junction can be found.

The lesion is ulcerated, has a high overall cellularity and has a nodular component in the subcutis. Comparative genomic hybridization shows loss of chromosome 6q, an aberration that is common in melanoma. There is also a gain of a small area in the distal part of 5q. Given these findings, I believe that this is best assessed as a spitzoid melanoma of childhood. I use this term for an emerging class of lesions that usually lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma.  While the thickness is approximately 4.5 mm., it would be a mistake to use prognostic data from adult melanoma cases in this setting. The prognosis is far better. As the lesion extends to a dermal margins, a narrow re-excision is reasonable. Lesions of this type are usually well circumscribed, and I have not seen regrowth when narrow but clear margins have been obtained. The role of sentinel lymph nodes is debatable, as sentinel lymph node involvement is common, but distant metastasis is rare.","Sections show enlarged spindled and fusiform melanocytes arrayed in nests and fascicles in compound fashion. Large nests and fascicles are apparent at the junction in concert with acanthosis (and also central erosion), and many coalescing fascicles reside in the dermis and upper subcutis below that in concert with a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. There is only partial maturation with descent. Dermal melanocytes in mitosis can be found, especially in the upper half of the proliferation.",9,,,,,,F,1013148

Given the combination of these features and the findings in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, I believe that melanoma is the most appropriate diagnosis here. The base of the specimen is focally involved. The final thickness measurement should be made after complete excision.","There is a proliferation of large melanocytes with a domed surface and a wedge-shaped base.

We therefore performed comparative genomic hybridization. This shows a gain involving a discrete area of 7p near its terminal end, a loss involving part of 7q and a gain involving the terminal end of 7q. Gains and losses within the same chromosome reflect severe genetic damage, and in this context favor melanoma. Furthermore, gains involving all, or part of chromosome 7 are common in melanoma.  Given the lack of ulceration, this is a T3a primary lesion in the 2009 AJCC staging schema for melanoma.","There is a broad-based  proliferation of melanocytes involving the epidermis and papillary dermis.

Rather, our differential diagnosis included an atypical Spitz nevus on one hand and melanoma on the other. To more fully assess this differential, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis demonstrated gain in chromosomes 2, 7q, 11q, 12, 13, 15, and 19. A segmental gain in chromosome 11p was also documented. As you probably know, the identification of multiple chromosomal gains or losses can be documented in most melanomas. In contrast, chromosomal gain/loss is not known to occur in melanocytic nevi. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points clearly to a diagnosis of melanoma. With respect to staging, this melanoma is non-ulcerated and shows Clark's level IV invasion. Further excision is warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.  Based upon the above clinical synopsis, we presume that a prior biopsy from this site was obtained.

Genomic analysis revealed loss in chromosomes 2p, 6q, 8p, and 12q, and loss of the entirety of chromosome 18 is also apparent. The presence of multiple genomic anomalies points to spitzoid melanoma as the best interpretation. Please note that childhood-type spitzoid melanoma represents an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Cases reported in the literature as malignant Spitz nevus probably represent the same entity. With respect to clinical behavior, there is a risk for extension to regional lymph nodes, but our experience to date suggests that the risk for seeding of widespread metastatic disease is low. This proliferation is narrowly excised in the available sections. Further excision remains warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.  As we reported previously, our differential diagnosis included a cellular epithelioid Spitz nevus on one hand and so-called childhood-type spitzoid melanoma on the other. The latter has now been proven as the diagnosis for this case based upon the results of aCGH analysis. We also completed immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system (with MART-1 labeled red and Ki-67 labeled brown) was included in our evaluation. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. Although the overall labeling index is modest, the MART-positive cells show focally increased nuclear expression of Ki-67, especially in the upper half of the proliferation, thus implying that cellular proliferation is focally elevated. This staining result is diagnostically inconclusive.","Sections show a domed, cellular, laterally demarcated compound proliferation of enlarged epithelioid melanocytes. The background epidermis is acanthotic but is also focally thinned. Within the epidermis and along the junction, there are single melanocytes and nests distributed relatively densely, and some of the junctional nests are sizable.

As you probably know, the identification of genomic gain or loss is common to the vast majority of melanomas. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as a desmoplastic Spitz nevus rather than melanoma. This proliferation is focally present at the periphery of this biopsy. Further excision can be considered to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished and that persistence does not ensue.","Sections show a domed compound proliferation of enlarged slightly spindled melanocytes that is somewhat asymmetrical.

To more fully assess this differential, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was utilized to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis did not demonstrate chromosomal gains or losses. GNAQ and GNA11 gene sequencing was also completed, and GNAQ exon 5 and GNA11 exon 5 were both found to be wild-type (non-mutated). Based upon the results derived from conventional microscopy and molecular assessment, I offer the following conclusions:  1. The lack of genomic aberrations, as demonstrated by aCGH analysis, speaks against melanoma as a possibility and favors interpretation as a peculiar melanocytic nevus. I do not believe this lesion should be interpreted as a pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (with respect to that diagnostic term, this proliferation is composed of melanocytes that have distinctly spindled cytomorphology).  2. The lack of mutation in GNAQ or GNA11 suggests that this proliferation fits better on the spectrum of pigmented spindle cell nevus or plexiform spindle cell nevus rather than blue nevus.  3. The proliferation is unusual and involves the deep edge of this biopsy. Further excision is thus warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished and that persistence cannot ensue.","Sections show an asymmetrical and focally ulcerated compound proliferation of slender spindled melanocytes with heavily melanized cytoplasm.

The portion of the lesion seen in these sections is just over 1 mm in thickness, but not ulcerated. The final thickness measurement should be made after complete excision. In determining re-excision margins, please keep in mind that most spitzoid melanomas in children are well circumscribed and recurrence at the biopsy site due to residual neoplastic melanocytes is rare, regardless of thickness, even with very narrow (e.g. 5 mm) margins. Also, involvement of sentinel lymph nodes is more common than in adult melanoma, but distant metastasis is much less frequent. Therefore, the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy is questionable.","There is a broad-based, dome-surfaced proliferation of large oval melanocytes coupled with irregular epidermal hyperplasia, compact hyperkeratosis and a proliferation of melanocytes that is broadly transected at the base of the specimen in the superficial reticular dermis.

Comparative genomic hybridization shows loss of chromosome 6q, an aberration that is common in melanoma. There is also a gain of a small area in the distal part of 5q. Given these findings, I believe that this is best assessed as a spitzoid melanoma of childhood. I use this term for an emerging class of lesions that usually lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma.  While the thickness is approximately 4.5 mm., it would be a mistake to use prognostic data from adult melanoma cases in this setting. The prognosis is far better. As the lesion extends to a dermal margins, a narrow re-excision is reasonable. Lesions of this type are usually well circumscribed, and I have not seen regrowth when narrow but clear margins have been obtained. The role of sentinel lymph nodes is debatable, as sentinel lymph node involvement is common, but distant metastasis is rare.","Sections show enlarged spindled and fusiform melanocytes arrayed in nests and fascicles in compound fashion.

The presence of multiple chromosomal gains is not known to occur in Spitz nevi and favors instead the above interpretation. The designation childhood-type spitzoid melanoma refers to an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Such tumors typically lack BRAF mutations and were reported in the past literature under such flawed designations as malignant Spitz nevus. Experience to date suggests a small risk for extension to regional lymph nodes with a low risk for widespread dissemination.  This tumor is transected at the deep edge of the biopsy.

The more striking cytologic atypia seen in the lesions that I term spitzoid melanoma of childhood is not evident. Similar lesions to this one have been reported under a variety of names, including atypical Spitz tumor. They tend to involve local (and sentinel) lymph nodes at a relatively high rate, but distant metastasis is unlikely. Given the sharp circumscription of the lesion, one could consider a re-excision of this site, but I have not seen lesions of this type recur when excised by even a few millimeters. With regard to sentinel lymph node biopsy, there is little prognostic information as there is such a disparity between a percent of patients with nodal involvement and distant metastases. Comparative genomic hybridization does not show clear-cut evidence of chromosomal gains or losses. Because deflections were present in the plotted CGH data, we consulted with our former colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian (now chairman of Pathology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Medical Center, New York) who agrees that no definite aberrations are present. The lack of aberrations does not exclude the possibility of melanoma, but makes it less likely (aberrations, especially multiple ones in loci characteristic of conventional melanomas would have resulted in an outright diagnosis of melanoma in this case). If one is looking for a more specific name for a lesion like this one, atypical Spitz tumor may be apt.  Please note that a margin of about a millimeter or so is present between the neoplasm and the peripheral margin. Lesions of this type are usually well circumscribed, and do not recur even with narrow excision margins, if the excision margins are histopathologically proven. Hence, I believe that this site could be treated with a reexcision of only a few more millimeters.","There is a proliferation of melanocytes with a domed surface and a wedge-shaped base.

To further address this differential, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis demonstrated loss of a small segment of distal chromosome 7q and gain in the proximal portion of chromosome 11p. Chromosome 11p gain can be seen in association with Spitz nevi, especially, large and cellular Spitz nevi, and this molecular aberration is not common to melanoma. The segment of chromosomal loss in 7q is quite small and is not believed to be diagnostically significant. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as a cellular Spitz nevus. We have not demonstrated molecular anomalies via aCGH that are supportive of a diagnosis of childhood-type spitzoid melanoma.

Cell proliferation analysis was completed via immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system in which MART-1 is labeled red and Ki-67 is labeled brown. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. The MART-positive cells show low nuclear expression of Ki-67, thus implying that cellular proliferation is very low, which is reassuring but not definitive. There is also general preservation of p16 expression, which also lends support to a benign interpretation. To definitively assess the nature of this tumor, we also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), with your approval. This approach was utilized to screen this tumor tissue for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies.

In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as an unconventional pigmented spindle cell nevus.

A p16 stain labels only rare cells (less than 5%). My initial assessment of this lesion was that it is not a conventional Spitz's nevus, but a lesion with low metastatic potential (referred to as atypical Spitz tumor in some studies). However, comparative genomic hybridization shows a loss of chromosome 9, and a gain involving most of chromosome 7. The chromosome 9 loss corroborates the near-total absence of staining for p16, as the gene is located on 9p.

This nodular proliferation developed secondarily within a preexistent Spitz nevus. I also understand that an adjacent congenital melanocytic nevus was noted clinically. To further assess the nature of this proliferation, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, completion of aCGH analysis demonstrated loss in chromosomal 1p with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. We have observed anomalies involving chromosome 1 in other examples of spitzoid melanoma. In summary, my interpretation of the the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH analysis is that a nodule of childhood-type spitzoid melanoma has developed secondarily within a preexistent Spitz nevus. The nodular population of melanocytes within this specimen is 1.6 mm in thickness. Please note that the negative prior analysis via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is unsurprising, as FISH testing only evaluates loci on chromosomes 6 and 11. To state it differently, the chromosomal anomaly that we have detected could not be identified via FISH.  The designation childhood-type spitzoid melanoma refers to an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Such tumors typically lack BRAF mutations and were reported in the past literature under such flawed designations as malignant Spitz nevus. Experience to date suggests a small risk for extension to regional lymph nodes with a low risk for widespread dissemination. The proliferation in this specimen involves the deep edge of the biopsy. Further excision is warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.","Sections show a compound proliferation of melanocytes that assumes a domed profile. In some areas, the background epidermis is acanthotic, and in other areas the background epithelium is thinned. In areas where the epithelium is expanded, there are single melanocytes and nests distributed within the epidermis at all levels, and large and well-formed pink globules (Kamino bodies) can be found above dermal papillae. Below this, there are nests and cords of melanocytes that in some areas mature with descent. In areas where the epithelium is thin, a nodular array of non-maturing melanocytes is appreciable. These cells are slightly spindled and epithelioid in morphology and have amphophilic or finely melanized cytoplasm. Within these nodules, melanocytes in mitosis are relatively easily found. A juxtaposed sparse infiltrate of lymphocytes is apparent as well.",2,,,,,,F,1009813

The best means to assess or refute this possibility is to complete array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis, which we pursued. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis did not reveal any chromosomal gains or losses. As you know, the vast majority of melanomas, including childhood-type melanomas, harbor various genomic anomalies. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH does not provide support for a diagnosis of melanoma. I believe this unusual proliferation represents a hypercellular Spitz nevus. The process appears excised in the available planes of section.","Sections show enlarged melanocytes arrayed as gargantuan nests and fascicles in compound fashion in concert with acanthosis in a sessile polypoid skin segment.

To further assess this differential via molecular means, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss of chromosome 7p as well as focal gain in chromosome 7q. No other chromosomal copy number aberrations were identified. As background, please note that chromosomal copy number aberrations involving multiple chromosomes can be identified in the vast majority of melanomas evaluated via aCGH, while most melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. A subset of Spitz nevi demonstrate aberrations involving a single chromosome, including chromosomes 7, 11, and 15. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced clear support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, I believe this proliferation represents an unconventional Spitz nevus with associated gain in chromosome 7q. My colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian, reviewed the aCGH tracing for this case and is in agreement with my diagnostic interpretation.  We recommend complete reexcision of this site in follow-up to be certain there is not possibility of local persistence.","Sections show a compound, wedge-shaped, slightly asymmetrical proliferation of spindled and epithelioid melanocytes arrayed as nests and fascicles which are vertically oriented in the dermis and focally along the junction of an epidermis that is acanthotic.

A p16 stain is positive in about 30% of lesional nuclei. Testing with comparative genomic hybridization shows a gain involving much of the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q), and one involving 22q. Although these are not among the very most commonly affected loci in melanoma, gains in both of these areas are seen in a proportion of typical melanomas.  The lesion extends to within 1 mm of the margin in the reticular dermis.

Given these findings, I was concerned that this is a spitzoid melanoma and not Spitz's nevus. Comparative genomic hybridization shows no loss or gain of chromosomal material. This favors a benign interpretation, or a low grade neoplasm with limited metastatic potential (what some call atypical Spitz tumors). About 95% of conventional melanomas show detectable losses or gains with this technique. However, given the limited nuclear atypia and negative comparative genomic hybridization results, I cannot make a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma.

As this differential diagnosis is best addressed by inclusion of the results of molecular analysis, we pursued comparative genomic hybridization analysis via tissue array methodology (aCGH). After extraction of tumoral DNA, aCGH assessment demonstrated gain in chromosome 7q and no other genomic aberrations. Chromosome 7q gain as a monoaberration does not presently have defined significance. We have observed it in melanocytic tumors interpreted ambiguously. A monoaberration in chromosome 7q is not sufficient to warrant interpretation as childhood-type spitzoid melanoma. In summary, based upon the combination of conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH results, I continue to favor a hypercellular Spitz nevus as most likely.

Additionally, the striking confluence of junctional nests is of concern.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows no chromosomal gains or losses. Given these findings, I am unable to render a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma, and favor a unusual Spitz's nevus. The lesion appears to have been removed with a margin of about 3 mm on one side. It is very well circumscribed, and lesions of this type seldom recur in the scar from the previous biopsy. Also, it is very common for spitzoid lesions of all types (including benign Spitz nevi) to have small clusters of spitzoid melanocytes in a sentinel lymph node. The predictive value of this finding is very low, and I, for this reason, would not endorse this approach.","There is a well-circumscribed, dome-surfaced proliferation of melanocytes involving the junctional zone and superficial dermis. The base of the lesion is relatively flat, except in a central area where melanocytes extend along the access of an eccrine duct.

They reveal a gain of chromosome 13q.  This finding, while unusual, is not known to be associated with melanoma.  The overall histopathology of this case including enlarged melanocytes and scattered mitotic figures, one of which is atypical remains worrisome however, and the exact biologic potential of this lesion cannot be completely predicted.  Most larger series of this rare diagnostic category indicate that most patients are alive and well after treatment, which includes excision, and can include sentinel lymph node biopsy, (which may show metastatic foci).  Rare patients succumb to metastatic disease.  In this case, since the lesion extends to the edges of the specimen, a full thickness re-excision with a minimum of 5 millimeter margins is recommended.  I have reviewed this case with Dr. LeBoit who concurs with the diagnosis and treatment recommendationl.  The reference below represents one of the larger series related to this entity.

The dermal component features striking confluence of nests, and a mitotic rate higher than that in most Spitz's nevi. For these reasons, we performed comparative genomic hybridization. No chromosomal gains or losses were detected. In the context of the histopathologic findings, I favor an unusual Spitz's nevus. The lesion appears to have been narrowly removed.","There is a pedunculated proliferation of large oval melanocytes seen beneath an irregularly hyperplastic and focally atrophic epidermis, encompassed by epithelial collarettes. Extending from the junctional zone to the flat base of the lesion in the upper reticular dermis is a proliferation of large oval melanocytes with relatively monomorphous oval vesicular nuclei that contain small nucleoli.

To further substantiate the nature of this proliferation, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated chromosomal copy number aberrations. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed a tiny segmental gain in chromosome 7q with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. This is an aberration that we have identified in association with a small number of desmoplastic Spitz nevi. As you know, most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. (Importantly, only a small segmental aberration involving a single chromosome was identified in association with this proliferation, and thus the aCGH profile is not suggestive of melanoma.) In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of melanoma. I believe this proliferation represents an unusual desmoplastic Spitz nevus. As this biopsy is only partial in nature, further excision is recommended to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.","Sections show a broad, slightly asymmetrical and compound proliferation of enlarged slightly spindled and epithelioid melanocytes. Within the epidermis, single melanocytes and nests are distributed along the sides and bases of elongated rete, and in one focus there is scatter of melanocytes above the junction. In fibrotic and sclerotic reticular dermis below this, there are partially maturing nests, cords, and fascicles of similar melanocytes distributed broadly, and extension to the inked edges of the specimen is noted. A multifocal juxtaposed lymphocytic infiltrate is present concurrently. The melanocytes in the dermis show avid expression of p16 and have a low Ki-67 cell proliferation index.

Rather, our differential diagnosis included an atypical Spitz nevus on one hand and childhood-type spitzoid melanoma on the other. Cell proliferation analysis was completed via immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system in which MART-1 is labeled red and Ki-67 is labeled brown. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. The MART-positive cells show modestly elevated nuclear expression of Ki-67, thus implying that cellular proliferation is elevated. This staining result is of concern but is not specifically diagnostic. To more fully assess the nature of this proliferation, we also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed equivocal segmental loss in distal chromosome 8p with no other chromosomal gains or losses. As you probably know, most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while virtually all melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. The aCGH profile that we have defined here is not specific.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced clear support for a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, I favor an unconventional (or atypical) Spitz nevus as most likely. The proliferation abuts the specimen periphery in the available sections. In light of this, conservative complete reexcision of this site represents a follow-up step worthy of consideration. If there is no apparent residuum, then close clinical monitoring of the biopsy site could also be considered as a possibility.","Sections show enlarged melanocytes arrayed in compound fashion within a sessile, protuberant skin segment.

Per your request, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) assessment of this tumor to screen for melanoma-associated genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in chromosome 9 with equivocal segmental loss in chromosomes 7p and 8p. The identification of chromosome 9 loss represents an ambiguous aCGH result. We have identified chromosome 9 loss as a monoaberration in some melanomas, but we have also found chromosome 9 loss in proliferations in which the best expert microscopic interpretation was as a melanocytic nevus. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced an unequivocal diagnosis. Based solely upon conventional microscopy, I favor an unconventional deep penetrating melanocytic nevus as most likely. The results of our aCGH analysis have additionally raised melanoma of 1.6 mm in thickness as a diagnostic possibility. The proliferation appears excised in the available planes of section in the current specimen. Additional excision and ongoing clinical follow-up will be necessary in light of the fact that melanoma has now been raised as a distinct possibility in the differential diagnosis.","The submitted level sections demonstrate a sessile skin segment that harbors a dermal proliferation of melanocytes arrayed in nested, fascicular, and syncytial fashion. Near the junctional zone, epithelioid melanocytes with pale or finely melanized cytoplasm are arrayed in coalescing fashion, and subjacent to this there are coalescing fascicles of slightly spindled melanocytes with similar cytoplasmic qualities. As one extends more deeply in the dermis, the melanocytes become smaller with descent and occasionally are wrapped around tiny peripheral nerves or abut vascular channels. Extension into the subjacent reticular dermis is coupled with a marked diminishment in cell size and an interstitial distribution. Dermal melanocytes in mitosis are not easily found, and the Ki-67 cell proliferation index appears to be relatively low.",45,,,,,,F,1075307

Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a low proliferation rate (my estimate is between 1 and 3%). A phosphohistone H3 immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows positive nuclei among the large, spindled melanocytes. Comparative genomic hybridization shows gains and losses in portions of both the short and long arms of chromosome 7, and and area of loss near the terminal portion of chromosome 16q. While chromosome 7q gains can occur in some Spitz's nevi, the mixture of gains and losses within the same chromosome seen here favors a spitzoid melanoma. If the lesion has been re-excised, I would prefer to issue a final report after seeing the residuum.","There is a proliferation of large fusiform and oval melanocytes involving the superficial, mid and focally the deep reticular dermis. There are fascicles of cells with large vesicular or diffusely hyperchromatic nuclei and relatively small nucleoli, some positioned along the axes of folliculosebaceous units.

Lesions of this type are generally well circumscribed. In this case, the dermal and subcutaneous margins appear involved, and a narrow reexcision should be performed to prevent regrowth. My experience is that lesions of this type seldom recur with 5 mm margins. Involvement of local lymph nodes is common, but distant metastasis is rare. We obtained comparative genomic hybridization on this case. There is a clear cut loss involving chromosome 1p, without other aberrations. Certain chromosomal gains and losses are typical of melanoma, but this is not one of them. Idiosyncratic ones such as those seen here may occur in so-called atypical Spitz tumors. In general, Spitz's nevi have gains of 11p alone, 7q alone, or no aberrations. Hence, the results are intermediate, and although abnormal are not interpretable as melanoma.  Dr. Boris Bastian, my colleague who developed diagnostic comparative genomic hybridization also reviewed the results of this test and agrees with this interpretation of it.","Sections show a dome-surfaced, somewhat wedge-shaped proliferation of large fusiform melanocytes that extends from the junctional zone into the subcutis.

Within the dermis, fascicles of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei that contain large nucleoli are present within fibrotic stroma. Clefts demarcate adjacent melanocytes from one another. Mitotic figures are rare, but at least one is present a short distance from the base of the lesion. The enclosed immunoperoxidase-stained sections include S100 and Melan-A stains that highlight the fascicular structure of the lesion, and HMB45 stain that shows some positivity throughout the entire thickness of the lesion, and a Ki-67 stain showing what appears to be an elevated proliferation rate (this is difficult to judge, as there are admixed lymphocytes).",5,,,,,,F,1053939

Given the clinical setting, we obtained comparative genomic hybridization. This shows multiple chromosomal aberrations, which in concert with the histopathologic findings favor interpretation as a spitzoid melanoma rather than as an unusual Spitz's nevus. These aberrations include losses involving most of chromosome 2 (with a gain of a smaller focus in the same chromosome), and gains involving chromosome 7q, 9p, 17q and 19p. Finding gains and losses in the same chromosome, as in chromosome 2 in this case is particularly suggestive of melanoma, as is the sheer number of aberrations; both point to a high degree of genomic instability. Some of the aberrations seen in this case are idiosyncratic (such as the gain in 9p; 9p is usually lost in melanoma) while others are characteristic of melanomas in adults (such as the gain in 7q). The lesion measures 2.2 mm in thickness, and may prove to be thicker on complete excision. Lesions of this type often involve sentinel lymph nodes, but the predictive value vis-a-vis extranodal metastatic spread is limited. If there are interesting or unusual findings in the reexcision specimen, I would be interested in viewing the sections as part of this consultation.","Sections show a somewhat asymmetrical, dome-surfaced proliferation of melanocytes with irregular epidermal hyperplasia in some areas and a relatively thin epidermis in others.

The thinned epidermis, mitotic rate and large, confluent nests in the superficial part of the lesion are all worrisome features.

Given these findings, despite the age of the patient, I believe that this lesion is best viewed as a spitzoid melanoma of childhood. I use this term for an emerging class of lesions that have a spitzoid morphology and a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. This makes sentinel lymph node biopsy less predictive than in adult melanoma. The thickness in this case is at least 1.8 mm as the lesion is transected. Thickness and prognosis are also not coupled in the same manner as in adult melanoma and the prognosis is also considerably better than with an adult lesion of the same thickness. Also, lesions of this type tend to be well circumscribed and excision margins can be considerably less.","There is a dome-surfaced proliferation of large oval melanocytes involving both the junctional zone of a thinned epidermis and the superficial dermis beneath it.

However, it captures the sense that the lesion does not conform to the standard features of a Spitz's nevus, but does not have sufficiently atypical findings for an outright diagnosis of melanoma. Comparative genomic hybridization with an array based method shows an isolated gain involving the terminal end of 7q. This aberration, when seen without other gains or losses usually occurs in benign lesions (similar to gains of 11p). Hence, an unusual Spitz's nevus is the most likely finding. A narrow re-excision would still be appropriate.","There is a dome-surfaced proliferation of large oval melanocytes involving the junctional zone, a thickened papillary dermis and the upper portion of the reticular dermis centered around a folliculosebaceous unit.

Also, the undersurface is more irregular than in most desmoplastic Spitz nevi. For these reasons, we obtained comparative genomic hybridization on this challenging case. This showed a loss of chr. 7p, and a gain involving chr. 15q. Gains, rather than losses of chr. 7p are common in melanoma. Gains of 15q can be seen in melanoma, but usually in concert with other aberrations. Hence, the findings do not provide unequivocal support for melanoma, but do indicate copy number changes not seen in routine Spitz's nevi. I would re-excision this site, and consider this as a lesion with some metastatic potential. I would expect the behavior of a group of lesions with similar findings to these to be better than that of a group of melanomas of comparable thickness.","There is a broad-based proliferation of melanocytes extending from the junctional zone to the deep reticular dermis. The undersurface of the lesion has a jagged border. The epidermis is hyperplastic, with nests of small fusiform cells with lightly pigmented cytoplasm.

Comparative genomic hybridization shows gains of chromosome 1q, 6, and 15.  The presence of genomic aberrations in this melanocytic neoplasm argues that this represents melanoma and not a severely atypical dysplastic nevus. The lesion is greater than 1 mm in thickness, is not ulcerated, and does not have detectable mitotic figures in its dermal component. Therefore it should be classified as T2a per the 2009 revision of the AJCC staging system for melanoma.","Sections show a compound proliferation of melanocytes that is well-circumscribed and symmetric.

The same findings were seen in the repeat testing, indicating that the copy number aberrations are in a significant portion of the lesion, and not just in a minor component. I favor regarding this lesion as an atypical Spitz tumor and not just as a Spitz's nevus. The removal appears complete. While lesions of this type have a high probability of involving a sentinel lymph node, the predictive value of this for distant metastasis is very low.","There is a roughly wedge-shaped proliferation of large oval and fusiform melanocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm and large oval vesicular nuclei with prominent and sometimes multiple, large central nucleoli.

Your submitted immunoperoxidase stains included a Ki-67 stain that demonstrates a low cell proliferation index. We additionally completed p16 and BAP-1 immunostains in our assessment. There is a marked loss of p16 expression, which implied that underlying loss in chromosome 9p might be present (this proved not to be the case, as is discussed further below). There is preservation of BAP-1 expression, and thus there is not an underlying anomaly in chromosome 3p. Per your approval, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as can be seen with melanoma. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed several contiguous areas of gain within chromosome 15q with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. (With specific reference to chromosome 9, no gain or loss was found.) We have observed gain in chromosome 15q as a monoaberration in a series of atypical Spitz (or pigmented spindle cell) nevi, and this genomic anomaly is not believed to be indicative of a diagnosis of melanoma. Rather, we believe the gain is a consequence of NTRK3 gene rearrangement.  In summary, although I had reservations regarding the possibility of nevoid melanoma based upon conventional histopathologic findings, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH favors instead interpretation as an unconventional melanocytic nevus (or unconventional Spitz/Reed nevus). My colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian, has reviewed the molecular findings for this case and is in agreement with my diagnosis. Given the complexity of this case, it would certainly be reasonable to complete reexcision of this site in follow-up.

While the distribution of melanocytes within the epidermis is irregular, and some of the cells in the dermis are moderately enlarged, other features raise the possibility of an unusual congenital nevus. The dermal component matures with descent in areas, and mostly has discrete aggregations of cells. As nevoid melanoma is in the differential diagnosis, I obtained immunoperoxidase stains. These include an HMB45 stain, strongly positive at the dermo-epidermal junction and weakly positive within only the superficial-most melanocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a near zero proliferation rate in the dermal melanocytes.  A scout section (the hematoxylin and eosin stained recut that we obtain at the time that sections are cut for immunoperoxidase stains) contained several melanocytes in mitosis. B  Comparative genomic hybridization shows a gain involving chromosome 7, a loss of chromosome 9, and a gain of most of chromosome 14. This combination of features indicates melanoma. Whether a component of nevus is also present could not be determined.  While the lesion is not ulcerated, the presence of melanocytes in mitosis in the dermis qualifies this lesion as T1b in the 2009 AJCC staging classification for melanoma.","There is a broad-based proliferation of melanocytes involving the epidermis and superficial dermis. The epidermis is hyperplastic, and there are increased numbers of single melanocytes and both small and large nests of them positioned at irregular intervals along the junction. Some branching rete ridges are evident, with subjacent fibrosis. There are nests, cords and strands of plump oval to small round melanocytes in the subjacent dermis, with some tendency to cluster around the upper parts of adnexal structures.",41,T1b,0.7,,Primary,,F,1015246

Isolated gains involving chromosome 7q can occur in Spitz's nevus. My colleague, Dr. Boris Bastian examined the comparative genomic hybridization examined the comparative genomic hybridization data and notes that the larger gain includes the MET locus. This finding has been seen previously in Spitz's nevus. Given that the changes are less straightforward than the finding of no gains or losses, or of an isolated gain of 11p or of the entire 7q arm, I would like to leave the diagnosis somewhat ambiguous, but favoring a Spitz's nevus. The neoplasm extends to the base of the specimen across a broad front, and if there is a significant residuum on re-excision, I would be interested in viewing the sections.","Sections show a broad based proliferation of large, oval and fusiform melanocytes, positioned as nests along the undersurface of an irregularly hyperplastic epidermis, and as smaller aggregations in a fibrotic superficial dermis. There are clefts between melanocytes and between them and  the adjacent epidermis. Melanocytes mature with descent within the dermis, and the sizes of their aggregations also diminish with descent.

Cell proliferation analysis was completed via immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system in which MART-1 is labeled red and Ki-67 is labeled brown. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity and a low Ki-67 cell proliferation index. We also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue bock, application of aCGH demonstrated segmental gain in chromosome 7q and loss of chromosome 9q. The presence of multiple chromosomal losses suggests genomic instability and favors interpretation as melanoma. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH favors interpretation as blue nevus-like (or deep penetrating nevus-like) melanoma. With respect to staging, this tumor is non-ulcerated and shows associated Clark's level IV invasion. Further excision is warranted to permit further microstage assessment and to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.","Sections show a domed segment of skin with a dermal proliferation of enlarged fusiform melanocytes with abundant, pale cytoplasm and dusty appearing melanin.

Immunoperoxidase staining using two colors (with MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red and Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively low cell proliferation index. However, some positively-labeled nuclei are apparent even in the deep dermis, which is of concern. We also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to further address the differential diagnosis between melanocytic nevus and melanoma. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed segmental gain in chromosome 7p and also in 7q. The presence of multiple chromosomal copy number aberrations indicates genomic instability and favors interpretation as melanoma. We have not observed gain in chromosome 7 in melanocytic nevi of any type.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH favors interpretation as an unconventional melanoma occurring in childhood. We refer to tumors within this spectrum as childhood-type melanomas. The designation childhood-type melanoma refers to an emerging tumor category that we believe is distinct from conventional (or adult-type) melanoma. Such tumors typically lack BRAF mutations and were reported in the past literature under such flawed designations as malignant Spitz nevus. Experience to date suggests a small risk for extension to regional lymph nodes with a low risk for widespread dissemination.  This tumor is 4.2 mm in thickness and is non-ulcerated. Further excision is warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished. I have received a call from Dr. Saadia Raza and will be returning her call to discuss the case.","There is a compound proliferation of melanocytes that extends into the deep reticular dermis.

Within the subjacent dermis there are coalescing nests, cords, and small syncytia of similar-appearing cells, some of which have even more abundant cytoplasm or larger and more hyperchromatic nuclei.

The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number aberrations indicates genomic instability and points to interpretation as melanoma. The identification of multiple chromosomal gains and losses is incompatible with any form of Spitz nevus. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH confirm that this proliferation represents melanoma and not a Spitz nevus. With respect to staging, this melanoma is less than 1 mm in thickness and lacks associated ulceration, yet melanocytes in mitosis are detectable in its dermal component.

As you probably know, the aCGH profile that has been demonstrated is incompatible with a diagnosis of melanocytic nevus.

The current FISH approach that is utilized analyzes (and thus potentially demonstrates) aberrations involving only chromosomes 6 and 11. This melanoma, which has multiple aberrations involving other chromosomes, would have a normal FISH profile. (This is not uncommon in spitzoid melanomas.)  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as melanoma.

These include a loss involving chromosome 6p, a partial loss of 6q, an amplification (high level copy number gain) of 7q, a loss of 9p and a loss of 9qter. Losses involving 6q and 9p are particularly common in melanoma. While isolated gains involving chromosome 7q can be seen in Spitz's nevus, gene amplifications (gains of not just an extra copy, but many extra copies) are not. Dr. Boris Bastian also reviewed the comparative genomic hybridization data and agrees with this interpretation of it.  The lesion is broadly transected, and may be considerably thicker than the 3.2 mm that I measured on the slide. Given the comparative genomic hybridization results and morphology, I believe that this lesion should be classified as a spitzoid melanoma of childhood, i.e., an emerging class of lesions that usually lack b-raf mutations (which are present in most melanomas) and have a propensity to involve local lymph nodes. Systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. Most lesions of this type are well circumscribed and relatively narrow re-excision margins are adequate for local control. The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy seems even less than in adult melanoma, as the predictive value of nodal involvement for distant disease is less, and there is little evidence that completion lymphadenectomy has an effect on survival.","Sections show a papillated segment of skin with a predominantly dermal proliferation of melanocytes, most of which have abundant, pale cytoplasm and large, oval vesicular nuclei.

Immunohistochemistry for p16 has been completed and demonstrates significant loss of expression, and thus an underlying anomaly in chromosome 9p was suspected. To more fully substantiate the nature of this proliferation, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for genomic copy number anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosomes 5p, 5q, and 7q, as well as loss in chromosomes 5q  and 9. The identification of multiple copy number aberrations indicates genomic instability, as is stereotypical of malignancies such as melanoma. Additionally, the fact that chromosome 9 loss has been documented correlates with the loss of p16 expression that was documented immunohistochemically. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as nevoid melanoma. With respect to staging, this melanoma is less than 1 mm in thickness, lacks associated ulceration, and does not have detectable melanocytes in mitosis in its invasive component. Therefore, it represents a melanoma of stage pT1a (2009 AJCC Guidelines). Further excision is warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.","Sections show a slightly asymmetrical, broad, yet laterally demarcated compound proliferation of melanocytes. There are single melanocytes and nests distributed at the junction, and virtually all melanocytes are immediately at the junction. Some of the junctional nests centrally are large.

To further assess the aforementioned differential diagnosis and screen this tissue for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies, we completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis demonstrated gains in chromosomes 1, 2, 6p, 7, and 8, as well as losses in chromosomes 6q, 11, and 22q. The identification of multiple chromosomal gains and losses decisively proves that this proliferation does not represent a melanocytic nevus but instead constitutes melanoma.

Cell proliferation analysis was completed via immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system in which MART-1 is labeled red and Ki-67 is labeled brown. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity and a low Ki-67 cell proliferation index. We also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue bock, application of aCGH demonstrated segmental gain in chromosome 7q and loss of chromosome 9q. The presence of multiple chromosomal losses suggests genomic instability and favors interpretation as melanoma. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH favors interpretation as blue nevus-like (or deep penetrating nevus-like) melanoma.

Many features favor a Spitz's nevus, but there are large aggregations deep in the lesion, a few mitotic figures at the level of the mid-reticular dermis and the melanocytic nuclei are more pleomorphic than usual. Complete excision, despite the cosmetically sensitive area is warranted.  Comparative genomic hybridization shows a gain involving chromosome 11p, and also one involving 7q. Isolated 11p gain usually corresponds to the formation of an isochromosome (two copies of 11p joined by a centromere), and has not been seen to date in melanoma. Spitz's nevi with this aberration are likely to have a mutation involving h-ras, and to deeply infiltrate the reticular dermis as single cells, findings that are present here. In this case, the 11p gain is not isolated but is associated by a gain of 7q. I consulted with Dr. Boris Bastian, at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, a colleague whose laboratory developed diagnostic comparative genomic hybridization when he was here at UCSF. He has not seen these two aberrations together, and heretofore regarded them as mutually exclusive. He believes that the current CGH picture still favors Spitz's nevus, even though the 11p aberration is not an isolated one.

As you know, the identification of multiple genomic gains and losses is indicative of genomic instability and is incompatible with a diagnosis of melanocytic nevus. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as melanoma. The designation childhood-type spitzoid melanoma refers to an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Such tumors lack BRAF mutations and were reported in the past literature under such flawed designations as malignant Spitz nevus. Experience to date suggests a small risk for extension to regional lymph nodes with low risk for widespread dissemination. In our experience, most tumors of this type are of very low grade.

After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in chromosome 11p as well as focal gain and loss in chromosome 7q. The identification of 11p gain indicates a desmoplastic Spitz nevus with associated HRAS mutation (a reference regarding this entity is listed below). The additional identification of an anomaly involving chromosome 7 is meaningless in the context of 11p gain. In our prior evaluation of this tumor, p16 immunostaining was completed and a near-total loss of expression is apparent. This result implied that a genomic copy number anomaly involving chromosome 9p might be present. However, our aCGH analysis proves this is not the case.

The extreme nuclear pleomorphism, with large bizarre nuclei, some containing macronucleoli and configuration of the lesion are findings by light microscopy against a conventional Spitz's nevus, or a well characterized variant. Morphologically, I favored designation as spitzoid melanoma of childhood. After discussion of the case with the child's dermatologist, Dr. Aimee Smidt, we have proceeded with comparative genomic hybridization. This showed multiple aberrations, consistent with melanoma. These included a set of aberrations involving chromosome 6p, with high level amplifications of the peri-telomeric and peri-centromeric areas, and a loss of the broader area in between them. Other losses include 8p, 11q and 19q, with a gain involving 19p.  The lesion is over 7 mm in thickness, which ordinarily would qualify this non-ulcerated neoplasm as stage T4 melanoma. While there is a propensity for lesions like this one to involve local lymph nodes, systemic spread either occurs infrequently or it does so in a delayed fashion compared to adult melanoma. This lessens the predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy and the therapeutic value of completion lymphadenectomy even when nodes are positive.","There is a large, a pedunculated segment of skin with a proliferation of large, oval, fusiform and spindled cells throughout the dermis.

To provide some context for the eventual findings, I performed a few immunostains. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows many nuclei with what appear to be mitotic figures in melanocytes in the lower half of the lesion. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show significant loss of that tumor suppressor gene product. Comparative genomic hybridization shows gains involving chromosomes 12p and 15q. This is an unusual result. I shared the comparative genomic hybridization data with my colleagues, Drs. Boris Bastian and Iwei Yeh. They do not regard these aberrations as indicating melanoma, as more typical ones would. There may be a gene fusion mechanism in this case, as has been seen with other spitzoid lesions in studies from their lab.  An atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have feature more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy. If there are significant findings on re-excision, I would appreciate a chance to see the sections. Most lesions of this type are well circumscribed, and the re-excision should be deeper, but necessarily more than a few mms. wider that the prior biopsy site or an visible residuum.","There is a mostly intradermal proliferation of large, oval melanocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm and large, but monomorphous oval vesicular nuclei.

These are unusual melanocytic lesions with some features similar to those of blue nevus, but with a different genomic origin and the presence of some junctional nests. There are deep penetrating nevus-like melanomas, and in some controversies about the essential nature of this entity. Hence, I performed immunostaining. Immunostaining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a high proliferative rate in the lesional cells, with up to 30% of the cells in occasional nests having positively stained nuclei. A phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle) shows only rare positive nuclei. A p16 immunoperoxidase stain does not show loss of that tumor suppressor gene product.  Given the unusual features in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections (the degree of confluence of dermal aggregations, and the degree of nuclear pleomorphism), as well as the high proliferative rate noted above, one would ideally achieve unequivocally clear margins around such a lesion. The current margins are less than 0.2 mm.  Following our discussion, and the history of brain tumor followed by radiation, I have requested a p53 immunoperoxidase stain, as some neoplasms due to radiation have p53 mutations that stabilize the protein, and lead to immunohistochemical positivity. The staining is negative.  Comparative genomic hybridization did not show chromosomal gains or losses, a finding that is strongly against melanoma.","Sections show a compound, wedge-shaped proliferation of large oval melanocytes with  pleomorphic vesicular nuclei and abundant vacuolated cytoplasms, arranged as small nests and fascicles.

However, the patient recently noted a more rapid rate of growth. My initial differential diagnosis included an unusual nevus with Spitzoid features and melanoma. To further evaluate for this differential diagnosis, I performed comparative genomic hybridization on this specimen. This is a molecular technique that evaluates for the presence of chromosomal gains or losses. It is based on the presence of chromosomal gains and losses in about 95% of melanomas, but with the exception of a gain of 11p, a lack of them in Spitz's nevi.  The comparative genomic hybridization has now been completed and it shows multiple chromosomal gains and losses, indicating a level of genomic instability found in melanoma and not in nevi.  In particular there is a loss of chromosome 6q, a gain of chromosome 7q, both a loss and a gain of chromosome 12p and a gain of chromosome 18q. The presence of multiple gains and losses supports the diagnosis of melanoma.  With regard to staging, the melanoma is between 2-4 millimeters in thickness and is not ulcerated. Therefore it should be classified as pT3a per the 2009 revision of the AJCC staging system for melanoma.  My colleague, Dr. Timothy McCalmont, also reviewed these sections and agrees with this diagnosis and assessment.","Sections show a dome-shaped segment of acral skin in which there is a compound proliferation of melanocytes, some of which are large and epithelioid, and the junctional component of which is arrayed with the lowermost sections of an epithelium that is slightly acanthotic and hyperkeratotic.

This chromosome is not commonly lost in melanoma, and the meaning of this finding is not clear.

To more fully assess this differential diagnosis and to screen for genomic copy number anomalies, as can be seen with melanoma, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss of chromosome 6q and gain in chromosome 15q. (The loss in chromosome 6q includes the location of the MYB gene that is assayed as part of standard fluorescence in situ hybridization copy number analysis of melanocytic tumors.) No other substantive chromosomal copy number gains or losses were noted. The identification of multiple copy number abnormalities suggests genomic instability, as is typical of malignancies such as melanoma. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH favors interpretation as nevoid melanoma. With respect to staging, this melanoma is between 1-2 mm in thickness and lacks associated ulceration. Therefore, it represents melanoma of stage pT2a (2009 AJCC Guidelines). Further excision is warranted to ensure that local control has been established.

The second population of larger epithelioid melanocytes has pale, ballooned, or finely pigmented cytoplasm. These cells are distributed erratically along the junction and in pagetoid fashion within adnexa, and several large nests of these melanocytes are present in the dermis as well.

Genomic analysis revealed loss in chromosomes 2p, 6q, 8p, and 12q, and loss of the entirety of chromosome 18 is also apparent. The presence of multiple genomic anomalies points to spitzoid melanoma as the best interpretation. Please note that childhood-type spitzoid melanoma represents an emerging entity that we believe is distinct from conventional adult melanoma. Cases reported in the literature as malignant Spitz nevus probably represent the same entity. With respect to clinical behavior, there is a risk for extension to regional lymph nodes, but our experience to date suggests that the risk for seeding of widespread metastatic disease is low. This proliferation is narrowly excised in the available sections. Further excision remains warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.  As we reported previously, our differential diagnosis included a cellular epithelioid Spitz nevus on one hand and so-called childhood-type spitzoid melanoma on the other. The latter has now been proven as the diagnosis for this case based upon the results of aCGH analysis. We also completed immunoperoxidase staining utilizing a two-color development system (with MART-1 labeled red and Ki-67 labeled brown) was included in our evaluation. By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity. Although the overall labeling index is modest, the MART-positive cells show focally increased nuclear expression of Ki-67, especially in the upper half of the proliferation, thus implying that cellular proliferation is focally elevated. This staining result is diagnostically inconclusive.","Sections show a domed, cellular, laterally demarcated compound proliferation of enlarged epithelioid melanocytes. The background epidermis is acanthotic but is also focally thinned. Within the epidermis and along the junction, there are single melanocytes and nests distributed relatively densely, and some of the junctional nests are sizable.

After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis did not reveal any chromosomal gains or losses. As you probably know, the identification of genomic gain or loss is common to the vast majority of melanomas. In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH points to interpretation as a desmoplastic Spitz nevus rather than melanoma. This proliferation is focally present at the periphery of this biopsy. Further excision can be considered to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished and that persistence does not ensue.","Sections show a domed compound proliferation of enlarged slightly spindled melanocytes that is somewhat asymmetrical.

To more fully assess this differential, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was utilized to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, aCGH analysis did not demonstrate chromosomal gains or losses. GNAQ and GNA11 gene sequencing was also completed, and GNAQ exon 5 and GNA11 exon 5 were both found to be wild-type (non-mutated). Based upon the results derived from conventional microscopy and molecular assessment, I offer the following conclusions:  1. The lack of genomic aberrations, as demonstrated by aCGH analysis, speaks against melanoma as a possibility and favors interpretation as a peculiar melanocytic nevus. I do not believe this lesion should be interpreted as a pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (with respect to that diagnostic term, this proliferation is composed of melanocytes that have distinctly spindled cytomorphology).  2. The lack of mutation in GNAQ or GNA11 suggests that this proliferation fits better on the spectrum of pigmented spindle cell nevus or plexiform spindle cell nevus rather than blue nevus.  3. The proliferation is unusual and involves the deep edge of this biopsy. Further excision is thus warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished and that persistence cannot ensue.","Sections show an asymmetrical and focally ulcerated compound proliferation of slender spindled melanocytes with heavily melanized cytoplasm.

The portion of the lesion seen in these sections is just over 1 mm in thickness, but not ulcerated. The final thickness measurement should be made after complete excision. In determining re-excision margins, please keep in mind that most spitzoid melanomas in children are well circumscribed and recurrence at the biopsy site due to residual neoplastic melanocytes is rare, regardless of thickness, even with very narrow (e.g. 5 mm) margins. Also, involvement of sentinel lymph nodes is more common than in adult melanoma, but distant metastasis is much less frequent. Therefore, the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy is questionable.","There is a broad-based, dome-surfaced proliferation of large oval melanocytes coupled with irregular epidermal hyperplasia, compact hyperkeratosis and a proliferation of melanocytes that is broadly transected at the base of the specimen in the superficial reticular dermis.

By this staining method, we found diffuse MART-1 reactivity and a low Ki-67 cell proliferation index. We also completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue bock, application of aCGH demonstrated segmental gain in chromosome 7q and loss of chromosome 9q.

I would look at the clinical images in paper #2 and biopsy any nevi similar to this one, or to those in the article. A family history of ocular or cutaneous melanoma, or synovial sarcoma should also be obtained. Most lesions of this type are spontaneous, however. A very narrow re-excision to prevent regrowth would be prudent. If there was a pre-operative photograph, we would greatly appreciate having it for our teaching collection.  To date, there is no link between tanning booth or UV exposure and nevi of this type.","There is a compound proliferation of large, oval melanocytes with abundant, pale slightly vacuolated amphophilic cytoplasm and large, vesicular nuclei with large central nucleoli. The lesion has a raised, slightly papillated surface, and a relatively thin epidermis. The lesional melanocytes are in closely apposed aggregations in the upper part of the lesion with a more dispersed pattern lower in it. Melanocytes mature with descent within the dermis, and the sizes of their aggregations also diminish with descent.

I favor the surface of a compound Spitz nevus, but some unconventional (or atypical) features are present, and the extent of subjacent dermal involvement cannot be evaluated because of the superficial nature of the biopsy. There are at least two ways to proceed in the management of this case. One is to complete conservative reexcision of this site and obtain any residuum for further histopathologic assessment. The other is to pursue comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to screen this tumor for chromosomal copy number abnormalities, as can be found in association with spitzoid melanoma. (The latter option was selected, as is discussed further below.) Per a clinical request, we completed CGH analysis to screen for genomic copy number anomalies. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in distal chromosome 7q with no other chromosomal gains or losses. As background for understanding this result, please note that most melanomas analyzed via aCGH demonstrate multiple associated chromosomal copy number gains or losses, while most melanocytic nevi lack such aberrations. We have identified gain in chromosome 7q as a monoaberration in a subset of unconventional Spitz nevi.  In summary, the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy coupled with aCGH has not produced support for a diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma. Rather, our analysis supports interpretation as an unconventional Spitz nevus. Given the complexity of this assessment, reexcision of this site would be reasonable to ensure local control and prevent persistence.  The technical methodology utilized in our aCGH analysis is described in the following reference: McCalmont TH, Vemula S, Sands P, Bastian BC. Molecular-microscopical correlation in dermatopathology. J Cutan Pathol. 2011; 38:323-5.","Sections show a domed compound proliferation of enlarged fusiform melanocytes with amphophilic cytoplasm. These cells are distributed singly and in nests and large fascicles within the epidermis, which is acanthotic, and limited scatter above the junction can be seen. Some large nests are accompanied by perijunctional edema, and some mitotic figures can be found within large junctional collections. In fibrotic dermis below this, there are much smaller nests and cords of similar melanocytes, but most of the dermis cannot be visualized because of the superficial nature of the biopsy.",9,,,,,,F,1293660

However, given the diagnostic controversy that had surrounded this case, we pursued array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block (from a hypercellular focus), aCGH analysis was completed and demonstrated gains in chromosomes 6p, 8q, and 17q as well as losses in chromosomes 6q, 9p, 11q, and 16q. The presence of multiple chromosomal gains and losses is not an alteration that is known to occur in cellular blue nevi (or even in so-called atypical cellular blue nevi) and suggests instead that a component of melanoma is present. In summary, based upon the combination of results derived from conventional microscopy and aCGH, I believe this breast lesion includes a component of blue nevus-like melanoma that developed within a background of cellular blue nevus. The component of melanoma is not obvious and fully distinctive microscopically, at least to my eye, and thus molecular assessment proved to be instrumental in rendering the above interpretation. This melanoma cannot be staged by conventional microscopical parameters.  I do not know the status of the final surgical margin for this case. The fact that this specimen is listed as a mastectomy specimen leads me to presume that complete excision has been achieved.","Sections show segments of breast parenchyma, and within these segments there is a proliferation of plump spindled and slender dendritic melanocytes encompassed by a sclerotic fibrous matrix. In many areas, the proliferation consists of small dendritic melanocytes encompassed by this matrix and accompanied by an infiltrate of many melanophages. In other, more cellular foci, there are nodules composed of coalescing fascicles of plump spindled melanocytes with pale or faintly melanized cytoplasm. In these cellular areas, melanophages are few in number. Cells in mitosis are focally present but are not readily identifiable. The Ki-67 cell proliferation index is extremely low.",72,,,,,,F,994917

These findings raised the possibility of a spitzoid melanoma. Comparative genomic hybridization shows chromosomal amplifications involving areas on 7p (near the terminal end) and 7q. The latter includes part of the b-raf gene. The fusion partner for b-raf in this case may be MAD1L1, a gene that has been seen as a fusion partner in other such cases. My colleague, Dr. Iwei Yeh also reveiwed the comparative genomic hybridization data and agrees with this interpretation of it.  Spitzoid lesions with b-raf fusions lack b-raf mutations (i.e. the sequence of the gene is wild type, but there is a break in the gene and the chromosome is attached at the breakpoint to its fusion partner). This mechanism can occur in Spitz's nevi, atypical Spitz tumors and in melanoma. An overview of the subject of braf fusions is in the paper from our group referenced below. The absence of other abberations in this lesion, with the exception of a low level loss involving chromosome 14q is against an outright diagnosis of spitzoid melanoma.  An atypical Spitz tumor may be the best category for this lesion. These are neoplasms that have feature more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.

CD34 staining demonstrates relatively diffuse fingerprint positivity, thereby corroborating that neural differentiation is present. An EMA immunostain proved to be completely negative, and thus there is not proof of perineurial differentiation (nevertheless, I suspect it may be present). Per the request of Dr. Vetto, we additionally completed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for chromosomal copy number abnormalities. as can be seen with melanoma. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed loss in in chromosome 9, loss of much of chromosome 7, and loss of distal chromosome 2. The identification of multiple chromosomal copy number abnormalities, with loss of chromosome 9 as the dominant finding, indicates that melanoma cannot be excluded from the differential diagnosis. However, based upon conventional microscopy, I cannot render a conclusive diagnosis of melanoma.  In short, this represents an ambiguous melanocytic tumor. If interpreted as melanoma, the tumor is 1.95 mm in thickness and is non-ulcerated.

Rather, our differential diagnosis includes an unusual combined melanocytic nevus or unconventional Spitz nevus, an 'atypical Spitz tumor' (a provisional diagnostic category), and childhood spitzoid melanoma. We completed BAP-1 immunoperoxidase staining as part of our evaluation, as BAP-1 loss (within chromosome 3p) can be detected in a subset of Spitz tumors with enlarged epithelioid melanocytes, similar to those seen here. The BAP-1 immunostain demonstrates preserved nuclear positivity throughout, thereby indicating that BAP-1 loss is not present. This is the type of challenging tumor for which array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can be of value. This technique was applied, as per your approval. After microdissection of tumor followed by extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block, application of aCGH revealed gain in distal chromosome 7 with no other associated chromosomal gains or losses. Gain in chromosome 7q suggests a Spitz nevus with associated MET genetic fusion. MET immunostaining was additionally completed and demonstrates positivity, thereby corroborating the possibility suggested in the preceding sentence.  This is an unusual melanocytic tumor.

To further establish the diagnosis for this tumor, we employed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to screen for melanoma-associated genomic anomalies. After extraction of tumoral DNA from the tissue block aCGH analysis revealed loss in chromosome 3 (3p and 3q) as well as losses in distal chromosome 9q and chromosome 19p. The documentation of multiple chromosomal gains and losses supports interpretation as melanoma, and the documentation of chromosome 3 loss, in particular, has been associated with blue nevus-like melanoma. I also considered the possibility of a metastasis of melanoma in my differential diagnosis, but I view this as unlikely. If there is any history of melanoma in this patient, please keep me informed.  This melanoma is non-ulcerated and shows associated Clark's level V invasion. Further excision is warranted to ensure that local eradication has been accomplished.","Sections show a cellular nodular proliferation of plump spindled melanocytes that spans the full reticular dermis and focally juts into the uppermost subcutis.

To further evaluate for this differential diagnosis, I initially performed a phosphohistone H3/Melan-A two color immunoperoxidase stain (this stain labels melanocytes in mitosis, or very close to mitosis in the cell cycle). The stain showed only a few melanocytes in mitosis or near to mitosis, which was reassuring.  Nonetheless, as an additional diagnositic maneuver, I performed comparative genomic hybridization on this case after receiving authorization from the clinical team who had discussed the testing with the family. This is a technique that assesses chromosomal gains or losses, which are found in melanoma and not in nevi.  The comparative genomic hybridization showed losses involving portions of chromosome 9p and 10q. The presence of two chromosomal losses is abnormal and supportive of melanoma. The melanoma measures 2.6 millimeter in thickness and is present in the tip margin. Therefore, by conventional AJCC melanoma staging guidelines, this would be considered a pT3a melanoma. However, given the spitzoid morphology of many of the cells, it is possible that this melanoma would behave in a less aggressive fashion compared with a conventional melanoma of equivalent thickness. My colleague, Dr. Timothy McCalmont, also reviewed these sections and agrees with this assessment.  This report was reissued on November 27, 2012 to add the patient's UCSF Medical Record number.","Sections show a neoplasm composed of fascicles of melanocytes, involving the superficial and deep dermis, with a wedge-shaped configuration.

Immunostaining using two colors (MART-1/tyrosinase labeled red, Ki-67 labeled brown) shows a relatively high proliferation rate in the dermal component (about 10-15%). A p16 immunoperoxidase stain show a mosaic pattern of loss of that tumor suppressor gene product, an indeterminate pattern. Comparative genomic hybridization shows a gain involving chr. 2p, and a complex combination of gains and losses involving chr. 7q. The breakpoints suggest a gene fusion involving MET on chr. 7 and DTCN1 on chr. 2p, a combination that Dr. Iwei Yeh, who also viewed the comparative genomic hybridization data has previously noted. This may lead to upregulation of braf (near one of the other breakpoints on 7q), in the absence of braf mutation. While the absence of other chromosomal gains and losses is somewhat reassuring, it would be best to view this as a lesion with limited but non-zero metastatic potential, e.g. as an atypical Spitz. These are neoplasms that have feature more atypical than those of a conventional Spitz nevus, but not as worrisome as those of spitzoid melanoma. In aggregate data from over ten studies, local nodal involvment (usually very small deposits) is common, but extranodal metastasis is rare. This dissociation results in sentinel lymph node biopsy having very limited predictive value, and in my opinion, sometimes leading to over-treatment if small deposits lead to completion lymphadenectomy.","There is a dome-surfaced compound proliferation of melanocytes featuring markedly elongated, jagged ridges and large oval and fusiform cells with variable amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei, amongst which mitotic figures can be discerned.

I do believe that reexcision of this site would be appropriate.","An excisional specimen demonstrates a compound proliferation of melanocytes that is subtly biphasic in configuration. Centrally, hypocellular sclerotic scarring is noted, and this stems from prior biopsies in this vicinity. Above this, there is a broad and badly circumscribed intraepidermal population of enlarged melanocytes. These cells are distributed singly and in small nests in lentiginous fashion along the junction, and prominent scatter of melanocytes above the junction is also noted.

With respect to staging, this non-ulcerated melanoma does not have melanocytes in mitosis in its small invasive component. Therefore, it represents a melanoma of stage pT1a (2009 AJCC Guidelines). Both the melanoma and the melanocytic nevus appear narrowly excised in the available sections.","Sections show a proliferation of melanocytes with a biphasic pattern. One population of melanocytes consists of cells with abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and finely divided melanin pigment, and these cells are arrayed irregularly within the epidermis as single cells and nests, with foci of suprabasal scatter.  There are also similar clusters of cells in the superficial dermis, surrounded by a lymphocytic infiltrate.  Laterally in the superficial dermis, there is a second population of smaller melanocytes (comprising melanocytic nevus), arrayed as nests and cords.",26,T1a,0.45,,Primary,,F,1303150
