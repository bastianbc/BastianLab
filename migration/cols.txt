Import legacy data into database
Ground rules:
1. If rows have the same Block number, they are from the same patient (e.g. 12-6261A and
12-6261B have the same number 12-6261)
2. If rows have the same Block prefix, they are from the same patient (e.g. HW2-Normal
and HW2-Tumor h the same prefix)
3. If rows have the same Sample prefix, they are from the same patient (e.g. DM3_Normal
has the same prefix as DM3_Tumor)
4. If rows have the same number in Patient, they are from the patient
5. If there are multiple area types with the same name from the same block, number them
(e.g. Melanoma1, Melanoma2).
6.
The consolidated.CSV spreadsheet is a list of samples. You will have to determine, how to link
new entries in SL to the upstream, NA, Area, Block, Patient, Project tables following the rules
above.
Prepare CSV file for pipeline
Once you have imported everything in the database, you will be able to produce the CSV file for
sequencing. You will need to have things in the database so that you can identify any matching
normal DNA from the same patient. A matching normal for an SL for any area type !=normal is
an SL from an area type==normal from the same patient.
Not all SLs have a matching normal SL, but we need to list the matching normal SL for those that
do.
This spreadsheet requires the following columns:
• SL id
• Bait,
• SeqRun ID,
• A list of all FASTQ file names [file1,file2,...]
• File path to the FASTQ files
• MD5
• NA type (DNA or RNA)
• Area type (normal for normal, tumor for all other like Melanoma, Nevus, etc.)• Matching normal SL id
